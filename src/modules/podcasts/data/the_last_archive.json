He wrote it in the voice of a black man from the south, a voice that changed American literature. Invisible Man is a novel made up of black voices that had been excluded from the historical record until, decades earlier, he’d helped record them with the WPA’s Federal Writers Project. What is the evidence of a voice? How can we truly know history without everyone’s voices? This episode traces those questions — from the quest to record oral histories of formerly enslaved people, to Black Lives Matter and the effort to record the evidence of police brutality.\n\n","subtitle":"In 1945, Ralph Ellison went to a barn in Vermont and began to write 'Invisible Man.'","pubDate":"2020-06-04T09:00:00.000Z","link":"https://thelastarchive.com/","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"audio/mpeg","url":"https://chtbl.com/track/39E17/traffic.megaphone.fm/CAD1421774658.mp3"},"duration":2679,"summary":"In 1945, Ralph Ellison went to a barn in Vermont and began to write Invisible Man.

What is a fact? What is a mystery?
