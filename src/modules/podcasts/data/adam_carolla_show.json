Adam asks him about his education background, and the guys go on to discuss the double-edged sword of the internet. They also talk about how psychedelics can change the way you think, why humans instinctively resist change, and Sam’s issues with religious doctrine. Later, Adam asks Sam about his argument with Ben Affleck on Bill Maher, and they go on to discuss the continued threat of jihadism, and what a post-racial society actually looks like. As the interview wraps up, Adam and Sam talk about wealth inequality. \r\n\r\nPLEASE SUPPORT TODAY’S SPONSORS!\r\nJB Weld - World's Strongest Bond\r\n\r\nBuyRaycon.com/ADAM\r\n\r\nTommyJohn.com/ADAM\r\n\r\nGeico.com\r\n\r\nBetOnline enter PODCASTONE",
