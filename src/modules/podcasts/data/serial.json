{"meta":{"title":"Serial","description":"Serial is a podcast from the creators of This American Life, hosted by Sarah Koenig. Serial unfolds one story - a true story - over the course of a whole season. The show follows the plot and characters wherever they lead, through many surprising twists and turns. Sarah won't know what happens at the end of the story until she gets there, not long before you get there with her. Each week she'll bring you the latest chapter, so it's important to listen in, starting with Episode 1. New episodes are released on Thursday mornings.","imageURL":"https://serialpodcast.org/sites/all/modules/custom/serial/img/serial-itunes-logo.png","author":"This American Life","categories":["News"]},"episodes":[{"title":"S03 Episode 09: Some Time When Everything Has Changed","description":"The state of Ohio decides where Joshua belongs.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/WH50mQO256w\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","subtitle":"The state of Ohio decides where Joshua belongs.","pubDate":"2018-11-15T10:30:00.000Z","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"audio/mpeg","url":"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/dovetail.prxu.org/serial/818c95d0-865b-4745-8418-b94b50d524c3/serial-s03-e09.mp3"}},{"title":"S03 Episode 08: A Madman’s Vacation","description":"A teenager decides to cooperate.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/gQKmC1JZJGI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","subtitle":"A teenager decides to cooperate.","pubDate":"2018-11-08T10:30:00.000Z","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"audio/mpeg","url":"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/dovetail.prxu.org/serial/5b9ff5ca-dc51-42ee-823a-dda92617bb8b/serial-s03-e08.mp3"}},{"title":"S03 Episode 07: The Snowball Effect","description":"If you listen closely to the trash-talking, you start to get the message.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/ZcVf2VfMru4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","subtitle":"If you listen closely to the trash-talking, you start to get the message.","pubDate":"2018-10-25T09:30:00.000Z","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"audio/mpeg","url":"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/dovetail.prxu.org/serial/07eb2827-921c-41ac-8159-42f4b481ee11/serial-s03-e07.mp3"}},{"title":"S03 Episode 06: You in the Red Shirt","description":"Life after you put a cop in jail.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/j49U57MRnos\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","subtitle":"Life after you put a cop in jail.","pubDate":"2018-10-18T09:30:00.000Z","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"audio/mpeg","url":"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/dovetail.prxu.org/serial/eab6397e-efe0-4de0-a679-6cb04d717cd5/serial-s03-e06.mp3"}},{"title":"S03 Episode 05: Pleas Baby Pleas","description":"Don’t tell the judges, but the prosecutors have the most power in the building.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/Gfua2bw4h8U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","subtitle":"Don’t tell the judges, but the prosecutors have the most power in the building.","pubDate":"2018-10-11T09:30:00.000Z","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"audio/mpeg","url":"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/dovetail.prxu.org/serial/3a4bb82a-b7ba-477b-80f8-eea434a94171/serial-s03-e05.mp3"}},{"title":"S03 Episode 04: A Bird in Jail Is Worth Two on the Street","description":"What happens when the right evidence points to the wrong man?<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/YyYZKUKM7Zk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","subtitle":"What happens when the right evidence points to the wrong man?","pubDate":"2018-10-04T09:30:00.000Z","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"audio/mpeg","url":"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/dovetail.prxu.org/serial/9c1f4acd-4971-40a1-9827-e845b4470fef/serial-s03-e04.mp3"}},{"title":"S03 Episode 03: Misdemeanor, Meet Mr. Lawsuit","description":"The smell of raw marijuana + acting nervous + hands in pockets = ?<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/cRhY_mxgaYA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","subtitle":"The smell of raw marijuana + acting nervous + hands in pockets = ?","pubDate":"2018-09-27T09:30:00.000Z","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"audio/mpeg","url":"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/dovetail.prxu.org/serial/91f4d2ef-b4ca-4787-a1b3-08cee3a77d94/serial-s03-e03.mp3"}},{"title":"S03 Episode 02: You’ve Got Some Gauls ","description":"When a judge believes he knows you better than you know yourself.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/serialpodcast/~4/x0jLdwIFVuE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>","subtitle":"When a judge believes he knows you better than you know yourself.","pubDate":"2018-09-20T09:30:00.000Z","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"audio/mpeg","url":"https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/dovetail.prxu.org/serial/aa7a0a3f-3e49-40d4-975a-ea64efb35bb7/serial-s03-e02.mp3"}},{"title":"S03 Episode 01: A Bar Fight Walks into the Justice Center","description":"A young woman at a bar is slapped on the butt.

He tells them what happened on January 13th. A few weeks later, he’s back at Homicide and his story has changed. In some ways, these changes are small and understandable.
