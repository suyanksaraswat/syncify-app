They discuss Kansas City's miraculous comeback and why it is hard to count them out of any game when Patrick Mahomes starts to get things cooking. They also discuss a few of Bill O'Brien's coaching blunders during the game and decide whether or not he deserves the blame for blowing a 24 point lead on the road. The guys also dive into the Titans vs. Ravens matchup and chat about why they think this Titans team has a team of destiny feel to them, discuss why they haven't offered Derrick Henry a massive contract extension yet, give praise to Ryan Tannehill, who despite mediocre stats, has done everything the Titans have asked of him in order for them to be successful, and chat about why they think Mike Vrabel has been a HUGE difference maker for the Titans. Later, 4x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, and Super Bowl Champion, Josh Sitton joins the show to discuss the Packers' huge win over the Seahawks at Lambeau on Sunday and looks ahead to the Conference Championship against San Francisco. Josh and Pat discuss the Jimmy Graham catch on 3rd down to seal the game for the Packers and how it is inexcusable that the NFL didn't have an additional camera angle to help the refs give an exact spot. Josh also recalls some stories about Aaron Rodgers from their Super Bowl run together, and why he thinks the media bashing Rodgers all year did nothing but add fuel to his fire. Josh and Pat also look ahead to the matchup with the 49ers and discuss what the Packers need to do to be successful against a very dominant, consistent football team (29:25-41:31). Pat also has some thoughts on the Browns deciding to hire Vikings OC Kevin Stefanski as Head Coach and whether or not that was the right decision, when 9ers Defensive Coordinator and other candidate for the Browns HC job, Robert Saleh dominated the coaching matchup between the two on Sunday. Pat also breaks down his thoughts on the Browns' potential GM candidate, and if all of this will equate to success in Cleveland.

First, Pat welcomes 4x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, former Heisman Trophy winner, NFL Offensive ROY, and Titans/Oilers Ring of Honor member, Eddie George. Pat and Eddie chat about this weekend’s Titans/Ravens game and why he thinks that Mark Ingram is the key to getting the Ravens going, and why he has hope for the Titans with Ingram being hobbled by a calf injury. Eddie also explains why he loved running the football in snow and cold weather, and if he thinks the terrible weather in Baltimore this weekend is going to play a factor. Eddie also talks a little bit about his time in Dallas and whether he thinks the Cowboys will ever be able to be successful again with Jerry being more important than the Head Coach, and Eddie gives his College Football Playoff championship game pick (2:40-19:55). Also joining the program is Super Bowl Champion, 5th pick of the 2006 NFL Draft for the Green Bay Packers, friend of the show, and one of the most hilarious humans on the face of the earth, AJ Hawk. Pat gets the pulse of the Packers from AJ who has had contact with Aaron Rodgers very recently and see’s where his head is at going into this weekend against the Seahawks at Lambeau. AJ breaks down what we should be looking for in that game, and why exactly Rodgers ramps it up during these types of games when everyone in the media is taking shots at him. Pat and AJ also catch up and take a few shots at one another in the process (24:39-39:38). Pat and the boys also react to Mike McCarthy’s first press conference as Head Coach of the Dallas Cowboys and also chat about Matt Rhule being introduced as the newest Head Coach of the Carolina Panthers and whether his coaching style will translate to the NFL.

Chris also breaks down the importance of running back's getting touches early in a game in order to get into a flow before the start of the 4th quarter, why he thinks this Titans team is long overdue to beat the Patriots, whether he thinks their dynasty is done, and why you can never count out Tom Brady (39:10-52:07). Also included is Pat's reaction to being named PFF's punter of the decade, and the guys all react to the College Football Playoff semifinal games, and look ahead to Trevor Lawrence vs. Joe Burrow in the National Championship.

Hue chats about why it is so difficult to win in Cleveland and what he thinks it comes back to. He also gives his thoughts on Freddie Kitchens and whether or not he thinks he has what it takes to be a successful Head Coach in the NFL, breaks down the Colin Kaepernick workout situation in Atlanta which Hue was supposed to lead, discusses what his next coaching stop might be and looks at a couple of situations that he might be interested in, and chats about his time on Hard Knocks and his interesting take on the whole experience (21:28-41:32). Next, former Head Coach of the Memphis Tigers and newly christened HC of the Florida State Seminoles, Mike Norvell calls into the show. He chats about his philosophy for landing recruits and how that job starts immediately upon being hired, how leaving Memphis was one of the toughest decisions he's ever made in his life, why he thinks he'll be successful at Florida State despite the ACC being Clemson's playground for the last several years, and what his involvement will be in the Seminoles bowl game (42:43-59:03). Also included is Pat's takes on all the Saturday NFL games this week (despite not being able to watch them as he'll be a field analyst for the Boca Raton Bowl), and how each and every game has playoff implications. They break down whether or not the Bucs should give Jameis a huge extension, if he would be willing to take a paycut, why this might be the week that the Bills finally take down the Patriots in Foxborough, and how the 49ers and Rams both still have plenty to play for. Pat also reacts to the announcement that Johnny Knoxville is back in the saddle for another Jackass movie that will be released in March of 2021. Today's show is a fun one. Come and laugh with us.

They discuss Florio’s bombshell on Twitter a few days ago that he has an inkling that Andrew Luck will be the Las Vegas Raiders Quarterback to start the 2020 season, and what the Raiders would potentially have to give up in order to get his rights. Pat also asks Mike whether or not another coach will get fired before the end of the season, and where a possible landing spot for Ron Rivera might be, when Jason Garrett will be fired, and addresses the idea of Tom Brady potentially playing for a different team next year (1:57-12:07). Next, 4x All-Pro, 3x Pro Bowler, Super Bowl Champion, the most accurate kicker in NFL history, Baltimore Ravens Kicker, Justin Tucker calls in. Justin and Pat discuss his game winning kick against the 49ers in the miserable conditions in Baltimore this past weekend, what his mindset and ritual is before he lines up to kick, what he has seen in Lamar Jackson over the last two years and if there is anything he can point that has led to his massive success. He also chats about his relationship with Matthew McConaughey, his potential career as an opera singer, and why this Ravens team has bonded so quickly (12:09-32:40). Pat also reacts to the news that Adam Vinatieri has been dealing with a knee injury for some time and the Colts having to bring in a kicker and what that process is like, and why it magnifies how important having a great kicker is, and gives a couple of thoughts on some of the early lines from this weekend’s NFL games.

He chats about the different rackets he had his hands in and what he did to become a major earner for the Colombo crime family. They also cover what kind of involvement the mafia has had in sports gambling and if he recalls any of those situations. Michael also gives his thoughts on The Irishman as he was intimately involved in the situation and was close with many of the people involved in the story, and tells Pat and the guys which mafia movies, in his opinion, are most accurate to the way things really are. He also covers how he is still alive, what his time in prison was like and if he was given any special privileges, what some of his favorite nicknames of associates were, and he dives into how he turned his life around to put himself into the position he is currently in. This is one of the most fascinating and interesting conversations that you’ll ever hear and something you definitely don’t want to miss (2:27-57:23).

He and Pat chat about the Myles Garrett situation and Joe gives his take as he’s known Myles for a long time, they cover his transition from the league into media, his thoughts on Dwayne Haskins’ offensive lineman blowing him off on the sidelines on video, and Joe admits that he was wrong about whether or not Lamar Jackson was going to be successful in the NFL (2:34-23:41). Next, former Pro Bowler and Super Bowl Champion with the Seattle Seahawks, Cliff Avril joins the show. He chats about being in London with Sky Sports and what he’s trying to do in the next phase of his career, what defensive lineman can do in order to try to stop a guy like Lamar Jackson and why it is proving to be so difficult, and he gives his thoughts on the potential of the new CBA and if he thinks a 17 game season would benefit everyone (25:36-32:26). Later, former National Champion for the Ohio State Buckeyes and current starting Quarterback for the DC Defenders, Cardale “12 Gauge” Jones, joins the show. He and Pat talk about the differences between the NFL and XFL and why some of these changes will help the game be more explosive, he looks ahead to this weekend’s Ohio State/Penn State clash and explains what it’s like playing in the Horseshoe on Saturday’s, and gives some clarity to his now infamous tweet about being in school to play football and not to study (32:28-44:24). Also included is Pat’s take on why moving the Chargers to Mexico City could make sense, but why it will be tough to ever execute, and the guys wonder why NBA ratings are down so much this season and what may be causing it.

Coach Fleck also addresses the people who think his coaching style is phony or fake, all while giving one of the most incredible inspirational speeches you will ever hear and will have you eager to run through a brick wall. He also clears up the rumors that Minnesota didn’t agree to play a night game in next week’s tilt against Penn State, and talks about what it means to be ELITE in the Minnesota Gophers program (3:22-19:19). Next, 2x Super Bowl Champion and former Pittsburgh Steelers legend, Ike Taylor joins the show. Ike and Pat chat about everything currently going on in the NFL, who Ike likes moving forward as we get closer to the playoffs, why he doesn’t think Tom Brady is going anywhere this offseason, the mentality it takes to be a great football player, and why that sometimes doesn’t mesh with other people’s expectations, and what he makes of the Baker Mayfield/beat writer drama and whether or not he or his teammates had any situations like that while he was in Pittsburgh (22:29-33:34). Lastly, 2x Super Bowl Champion, and current linebacker for the New England Patriots, Kyle Van Noy joins the show for an incredible interview. He and Pat discuss what it’s like playing for the Patriots, how many people will never understand Bill Belichick’s sense of humor, the controversy surrounding Sam Darnold saying he was seeing ghosts against the Patriots, what makes their defense so special, and what Bill Belichick’s message is when they huddle together on the sidelines during games (35:23-51:45).

He and Pat talk about his defensive philosophy, what he thinks of the defenses playing in the NFL right now, whether or not he’s gotten the itch yet to get back into coaching, how being in the media is different than being a coach, his career as an actor, and he elaborates on the shots he took at Cody Parkey (4:43-21:35). Next, arguably the greatest play-by-play announcer in the world, one of the most accomplished men in the industry, the voice of the WWE, Michael Cole, joins the show for an in depth conversation. He and Pat discuss the big news that Pat has coming up, Michael recounts a career that has spanned from covering political campaigns, to covering the siege in Waco, to civil wars, and ultimately to finding his way working for the WWE.
