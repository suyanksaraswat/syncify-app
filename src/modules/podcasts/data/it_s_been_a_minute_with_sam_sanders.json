But Serwer says 1868 is a better point of comparison – it was a moment of hope, when white Republicans had been fighting for black rights for years, before ultimately abandoning them to pursue white voters. Serwer sees Americans coming together in this moment, as they have in the past, but as a student of history, he says the backlash always comes eventually.","subtitle":"Sam talks to The Atlantic's Adam Serwer about this current moment in history and how it recalls the Nixon era and the Reconstruction era.","imageURL":"https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2020/06/08/gettyimages-1208801271-1-_wide-4eebbdc70f52309146d999d1bd47291a7ccb3bc4.jpg?s=1400","pubDate":"2020-06-09T07:00:00.000Z","enclosure":{"length":"25959792","type":"audio/mpeg","url":"https://play.podtrac.com/npr-510317/edge1.pod.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/npr/sam/2020/06/20200608_sam_adamserwer2final-4a326e99-6194-44a2-a8b5-bd7f179546f7.mp3?awCollectionId=510317&awEpisodeId=872281949&orgId=1&topicId=1136&d=1626&p=510317&story=872281949&t=podcast&e=872281949&size=25959792&ft=pod&f=510317"}},{"title":"Not Just Another Protest","description":"There is so much to unpack in this current moment.
