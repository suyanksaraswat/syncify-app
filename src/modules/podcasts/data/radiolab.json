Today we have the story of an experimental treatment that’s popping up all over the country: convalescent plasma transfusion, a century-old procedure that some say may become one of our best weapons against this devastating, new disease.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you have recovered from Covid-19 and want to donate plasma, national and local donation registries are gearing up to collect blood. </p>\n<p>To sign up with the American Red Cross, a national organization that works in local communities, head <a href=\"http://redcrossblood.org\">here</a>. </p>\n<p>To find out more about the The National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project, which we spoke about in our episode, including information on clinical trials or plasma donation projects in your community, go <a href=\"https://ccpp19.org/index.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<p> And if you are in the greater New York City area, and want to donate convalescent plasma, head over to the New York Blood Center <a href=\"https://nybloodcenter.org/donate-blood/covid-19-and-blood-donation-copy/\">to sign up</a>. Or, register with specific NYC hospitals <a href=\"https://nybloodcenter.org/news/articles/new-york-blood-center-collect-first-blood-plasma-donations-recovered-covid-19-patients-treat-severe-cases/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>If you are sick with Covid-19, and are interested in participating in a clinical trial, or are looking for a plasma donor match, check in with your local hospital, university, or blood center for more; you can also find more information on trials at <a href=\"https://www.trialsitenews.com/the-national-covid-19-convalescent-plasma-project/\">The National COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Project</a>.</p>\n<p>And lastly, Tatiana Prowell’s tweet that tipped us off is<a href=\"https://twitter.com/tmprowell/status/1242995804786302984?s=21\"> here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>This episode was reported by Molly Webster and produced by Pat Walters. Special thanks to Drs.

The news had us thinking about an episode we produced in 2014. We pulled apart one sentence, written in the hours after September 11th, 2001, that has led to the longest war in U.S. history. We examine how just 60 words of legal language have blurred the line between war and peace.</p>\r\n<p>In the hours after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, a lawyer sat down in front of a computer and started writing a legal justification for taking action against those responsible. The language that he drafted and that President George W. Bush signed into law - called the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) -  has at its heart one single sentence, 60 words long. Over the last decade, those 60 words have become the legal foundation for the \"war on terror.\"</p>\r\n<p>In this collaboration with BuzzFeed, reporter Gregory Johnsen tells us the story of how this has come to be one of the most important, confusing, troubling sentences of the last two decades. We go into the meetings that took place in the chaotic days just after 9/11, speak with Congresswoman Barbara Lee and former Congressman Ron Dellums about the vote on the AUMF. We hear from former White House and State Department lawyers John Bellinger &amp; Harold Koh. We learn how this legal language unleashed Guantanamo, Navy Seal raids and drone strikes. And we speak with journalist Daniel Klaidman, legal expert Benjamin Wittes and Virginia Senator Tim Kaine about how these words came to be interpreted, and what they mean for the future of war and peace.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, we check back in with Wittes, to see how the AUMF has trickled into the 2020s.</p>\r\n<p>Produced by Matt Kielty and Kelsey Padgett with original music by Dylan Keefe. </p>\r\n<p>Watch Congresswomen Barbara Lee's speech <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvnLtMKzX6Y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\"><strong>here</strong></a>. </p>\r\n","subtitle":" This hour we pull apart one sentence, written in the hours after September 11th, 2001, that has led to the longest war in U.S. history.

And if we threw out our human intelligence rubric, is there a fair way to figure it out?</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Obviously, there is. And it’s a live game show, judged by Jad, Robert … and a dog.</span></p>\r\n<p>For the last episode of G, Radiolab’s miniseries on intelligence, we’re sharing that game show with you. It was recorded as a live show back in May 2019 at the Greene Space in New York City.

It took three years for retired CIA employee David Sharp to get permission <a href=\"http://www.kansaspress.ku.edu/shacia.html\">to publish his account</a> of Project Azorian. And FOIA played an indirect role in that, as Cold War historians got the CIA to release, in redacted form, <a href=\"http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb305/\">an internal history of the mission</a>. After that and a threat of legal action, Sharp was finally able to publish his manuscript in 2012.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"> </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">We mentioned conspiracy theories that have swirled around Project Azorian filling the void where official silence has reigned.

But the conflict was to be between the US and China, as, according to the authors, the sub had powers to disguise its sonic signature as a Chinese Navy vessel.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"> </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">This book is the basis of the 2013 drama <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1922685/\">“Phantom,”</a> which features Ed Harris and David Duchovny as Soviet military officers who sip vodka in a very un-Russian way.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"> </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\">Russian Naval historians, <a href=\"http://www.northfleet.ru/\">like Nikolai Cherkashin</a>, are not only insulted by this take on the cause of the K-129’s demise, they say the true cause is much easier to pinpoint: They say an American vessel, possibly the USS Swordfish, <a href=\"http://english.pravda.ru/news/russia/10-09-2007/96959-sunken_submarine-0/\">collided with the Soviet submarine.</a> </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"> </p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height: 1.15; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\"><span>Despite the fact that the US government has turned over many documents about Project Azorian and what it found to the Russian government, many in the Russian Navy stand by their theory that it was far too easy for the US to locate the K-129 on the bottom of the Pacific, given the technology of the time. According to these theories, Project Azorian was nothing more than an elaborate cover-up disguised as... an elaborate cover-up.

Traveling at 17,000 miles an hour, we zoomed from the Rockies to the East Coast in minutes.

When we were putting together our live show <em>In the Dark</em>, Jad and Robert called up Dave Wolf to ask him if he had any stories about darkness. And boy, did he.

After hours of trying to fix the airlock, they were running out of the resources that kept them alive in their space suits and facing a grisly death. So, they unhooked their tethers, and tried one last desperate move.</p>\r\n<p>In the end, they made it through, and Dave went on to perform dozens more spacewalks in the years to come, but he never again experienced anything like those harrowing minutes trying to improvise his way back into the Mir.</p>\r\n<p>After that terrifying tale, Dave told us about another moment he and Anatoly shared, floating high above Earth, staring out into the universe ... a moment so beautiful, and peaceful, we decided to use the audience recreate it, as best we could, for the final act of our live show.</p>\r\n<p>Pilobolus creates a shadow astronaut during Dave Wolf's story on stage (photo by Lars Topelmann):</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://media.wnyc.org/media/photologue/images/bb/itd_astro_shadow_MG_9001.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\"></p>\r\n<p>The audience turns Portland's Keller auditorium into a view of outer space with thousands of LED lights (photo by Lars Topelmann):</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://media.wnyc.org/media/photologue/images/29/itd_leds_MG_0717.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\"></p>\r\n<p>Here's Dave Wolf in the dark darkness of space, performing a spacewalk in 2009 (courtesy of <a href=\"http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/shuttle/sts-127/html/s127e007210.html\" target=\"_blank\">NASA</a>):</p>\r\n<p><em><img src=\"https://media.wnyc.org/media/photologue/images/3e/s127e007096.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\"></em></p>\r\n<p>To give you an idea of what it looks like during the brightness of day, here's another photo taken in 2009 -- more than a decade after the adventure described in our podcast -- this time of astronaut Tom Marshburn (Dave Wolf is with him, out of frame, photo courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1425.html\" target=\"_blank\">NASA</a>):</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://media.wnyc.org/media/photologue/images/56/Astro_TM_372055main_image_1425_1024_768.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\"></p>\r\n<p><em>This episode was produced by Matt Kielty and Soren Wheeler. </em></p>\r\n<p><em>Support Radiolab today at <a href=\"https://pledge3.wnyc.org/donate/radiolab-it/onestep/?utm_source=podcast&amp;utm_medium=notes&amp;utm_campaign=membership&amp;utm_content=radiolab\">Radiolab.org/donate</a>.</em></p>\r\n","subtitle":"Astronauts at the International Space Station can make one request to talk to an earthling of their choice.

In researching border-crosser deaths in the Arizona desert, he noticed something surprising. Sometime in the late-1990s, the number of migrant deaths shot up dramatically and have stayed high since.

In this episode, we catch up on what's been happening (it's a lot), and learn about CRISPR's potential to not only change human evolution, but every organism on the entire planet.</p>\n<p>Out drinking with a few biologists, Jad finds out about something called CRISPR. No, it’s not a robot or the latest dating app, it’s a method for genetic manipulation that is rewriting the way we change DNA. Scientists say they’ll someday be able to use CRISPR to fight cancer and maybe even bring animals back from the dead. Or, pretty much do whatever you want. Jad and Robert delve into how CRISPR does what it does, and consider whether we should be worried about a future full of flying pigs, or the simple fact that scientists have now used CRISPR to tweak the genes of human embryos.</p>\n<p><em>This episode was reported and produced by Molly Webster and Soren Wheeler.
