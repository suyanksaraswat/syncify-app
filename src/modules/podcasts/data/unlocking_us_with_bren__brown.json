{"meta":{"title":"Unlocking Us with Brené Brown","description":"I’ve spent over 20 years studying the emotions and experiences that bring meaning and purpose to our lives, and if there’s one thing I’ve learned it’s this: We are hardwired for connection, and connecting requires courage, vulnerability, and conversation. I want this to be a podcast that’s real, unpolished, honest, and reflects both the magic and the messiness of what it means to be human. Episodes will include conversations with the people who are teaching me, challenging me, confusing me, or maybe even ticking me off a little. I'll also have direct conversations with you about what I’m learning from new research, and we'll do some episodes dedicated to answering your questions. We don’t have to do life alone. We were never meant to.","imageURL":"https://images.megaphone.fm/TFXDySS3C_n-VICaXBrW_80IYAHWZDCG2hVFTi3mtWQ/plain/s3://megaphone-prod/podcasts/919f580a-32fd-11ea-b53b-ff5b83b60e5c/image/uploads_2F1578587738450-3neoslimlpx-3f7a3cce941ace935a936c6c43b1c148_2FBrene%2BBrown%2BFINAL%2BCOVER_1800.jpg","author":"Brené Brown and Cadence13","categories":["Society & Culture","Relationships"]},"episodes":[{"title":"Brené with Austin Channing Brown on I’m Still Here: Black Dignity in a World Made for Whiteness","description":"Austin Channing Brown’s anti-racism work is critical to changing our world, and her ability to talk about what is good and true about love, about our faith, and about loving each other is transformative.
