However, there's never a right answer for the hiring the right person, as people have their own personalities and agendas. \nIt’s important that there is a strong hiring strategy in place when considering potential candidates and determine who the best people are to help lead the company to success is a must.\nNotice what other skills do they have aside from their resume? Are they great problem solvers, do they know how to navigate through a problem and what kind of attitude do they have when under stress? This shows that they don’t need to be micromanaged, and will be able to take direction and make successful decisions.\nHave effective communication\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/6MW3sR8\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6MW3sR8.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nEffective communication is an important building block for successful organizations. Communication promotes motivation by informing and clarifying the employees about the task to be done, the manner they are performing the task, and how to improve their performance if it is not up to the mark.\nCommunication can also be a source of information to the organizational members for decision-making process as it helps the team to identify and assess their course of actions.\nIt's best to analyze how you are communicating efficiently to maximize the flow of work and individual productivity. This includes being a good model of efficient communications. People who can send and receive messages clearly serve as an asset to a company's brand and are more effective in their jobs.\nCome up with a detailed plan\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/2OIuSlx\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2OIuSlx.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nDeveloping a detailed plan takes time and resources. Coming up with a plan sets the direction and establishes priorities for your organization. It defines your organization’s view of success and prioritizes the activities that will make this view your reality. The plan will help your people know what they should be working on, and what they should be working on first. Poor planning is often worse than no planning at all.\n A detailed plan essential if you want to have a successful business that's going to survive the startup phase. The process of writing a plan can do wonders to clarify where you've been and where you're going.\nSyncify\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/h6r5Tal\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/h6r5Tal.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nAn app that lets you be social at a distance.

However, there&#39;s never a right answer for the hiring the right person, as people have their own personalities and agendas. </p>\n\n<p>It’s important that there is a strong hiring strategy in place when considering potential candidates and determine who the best people are to help lead the company to success is a must.</p>\n\n<p>Notice what other skills do they have aside from their resume? Are they great problem solvers, do they know how to navigate through a problem and what kind of attitude do they have when under stress? This shows that they don’t need to be micromanaged, and will be able to take direction and make successful decisions.</p>\n\n<h4>Have effective communication</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/6MW3sR8\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6MW3sR8.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Effective communication is an important building block for successful organizations. Communication promotes motivation by informing and clarifying the employees about the task to be done, the manner they are performing the task, and how to improve their performance if it is not up to the mark.</p>\n\n<p>Communication can also be a source of information to the organizational members for decision-making process as it helps the team to identify and assess their course of actions.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s best to analyze how you are communicating efficiently to maximize the flow of work and individual productivity. This includes being a good model of efficient communications. People who can send and receive messages clearly serve as an asset to a company&#39;s brand and are more effective in their jobs.</p>\n\n<h4>Come up with a detailed plan</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/2OIuSlx\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/2OIuSlx.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Developing a detailed plan takes time and resources. Coming up with a plan sets the direction and establishes priorities for your organization. It defines your organization’s view of success and prioritizes the activities that will make this view your reality. The plan will help your people know what they should be working on, and what they should be working on first. Poor planning is often worse than no planning at all.</p>\n\n<p>A detailed plan essential if you want to have a successful business that&#39;s going to survive the startup phase. The process of writing a plan can do wonders to clarify where you&#39;ve been and where you&#39;re going.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Syncify</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/h6r5Tal\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/h6r5Tal.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>An app that lets you be social at a distance.

If you're a pessimist, your self-talk could be \"toxic\" and depressing.\nOur self-talk can have an influence on the way we see ourselves, and the world around us. Learn to shift that inner dialogue.

Sometimes, we unknowingly give toxic individuals influence over our thoughts, behaviors, and feelings. Dealing with negativity can be quite a downer.  It's important to regain your personal power.\nSeek out positive people to keep you balanced. Just like negative people can rub off on you, a positive person can brighten your spirit. Decide that you're not going to allow negative people to determine how you think, feel, and behave. Take back your power and focus your time and energy on becoming your best self.\nThe only person you have control over is you, so focus on your happiness. Rise above and remain positive.\nDevelop resiliency on being an entrepreneur\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/75IdDi4\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/75IdDi4.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nResilience is achieved through the consistent progress we make each day towards our goals. It is the ability to get up one more than you fall down.\nAs the saying goes, \"Fall down seven times, get up eight\"\nAs an entrepreneur, starting a business requires a lot of work - emotionally, physically and spiritually. It’s a never-ending path of setbacks, challenges, and potential roadblocks from start to finish. The struggles may be inevitable, but the way you frame your setbacks is completely up to you, and may be the very thing that helps you succeed.\nSyncify\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/h6r5Tal\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/h6r5Tal.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nAn app that lets you be social at a distance.

Sometimes, we unknowingly give toxic individuals influence over our thoughts, behaviors, and feelings. Dealing with negativity can be quite a downer.  It&#39;s important to regain your personal power.</p>\n\n<p>Seek out positive people to keep you balanced. Just like negative people can rub off on you, a positive person can brighten your spirit. Decide that you&#39;re not going to allow negative people to determine how you think, feel, and behave. Take back your power and focus your time and energy on becoming your best self.</p>\n\n<p>The only person you have control over is you, so focus on your happiness. Rise above and remain positive.</p>\n\n<h4>Develop resiliency on being an entrepreneur</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/75IdDi4\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/75IdDi4.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Resilience is achieved through the consistent progress we make each day towards our goals. It is the ability to get up one more than you fall down.</p>\n\n<p>As the saying goes, &quot;Fall down seven times, get up eight&quot;</p>\n\n<p>As an entrepreneur, starting a business requires a lot of work - emotionally, physically and spiritually. It’s a never-ending path of setbacks, challenges, and potential roadblocks from start to finish. The struggles may be inevitable, but the way you frame your setbacks is completely up to you, and may be the very thing that helps you succeed.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Syncify</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/h6r5Tal\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/h6r5Tal.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>An app that lets you be social at a distance.

Being surrounded by people who are caring and supportive helps people to see themselves as better capable of dealing with the stresses that life brings.\nSocial relationships can also help people to stay motivated when trying to achieve their goals. Talking to people who are going through the same experience can often be a source of support, empathy, and motivation.\nStrive to have the F words\nFabulous\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/iEfekqo\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/iEfekqo.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nIf anyone deserves to look and feel fabulous, it’s you. Feel amazing by feeling fabulous. Feeling fabulous is all about who you are inside and out. Being kind and nice to everyone around you and taking care of yourself. Remaining fabulous is not about looking fabulous, its about feeling fabulous and being your best self,\nFreedom\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/9TmK99C\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9TmK99C.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nFreedom is important because it really allows you to grow and mature in life. Freedom \"gives\" happiness because the state of being free is aligned with your true nature. The more you are aligned with your true nature, the more you are well.\nFinancial Indepenence\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/5KAHF6d\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/5KAHF6d.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nBeing financial independence is a major step towards your control in life. Financial independence is about freedom from money-related worries and ample preparation for the future.It is also about being able to leave a legacy to others through one’s generosity, passion, and life values.\nFamily\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/6kqcSa0\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6kqcSa0.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nWith the advancement of technology, changing cultural norms, new priorities, and new forms of communication fueled by the Internet, it's natural to wonder what the importance of the family is.

Feel amazing by feeling fabulous. Feeling fabulous is all about who you are inside and out. Being kind and nice to everyone around you and taking care of yourself.

Financial independence is about freedom from money-related worries and ample preparation for the future.It is also about being able to leave a legacy to others through one’s generosity, passion, and life values.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Family</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/6kqcSa0\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6kqcSa0.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>With the advancement of technology, changing cultural norms, new priorities, and new forms of communication fueled by the Internet, it&#39;s natural to wonder what the importance of the family is.

If you know your Why, you can drum up that little bit of motivation that you need to get started. From there, it’s momentum, not motivation.  Finding your Why will help you to eventually build self-discipline</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Subscribe!</h2>\n\n<p>If you enjoyed the podcast please <strong><em>subscribe</em></strong> and <strong><em>rate it</em></strong>.

This means that we have access to a wealth of information at our fingertips but it also means that we’re contactable in more ways, and in more instant ways, than ever.\nIt's important to create limits in regards to who we follow, what sort of content we consume, and how much time we spend on the internet. The amount of ‘buzz’ we receive from the digital world can, at times, become overwhelming. It can create anxiety and leave us feeling drained. Setting digital boundaries can help us to manage the way we interact with the digital world, which can ultimately help us to manage our mental health.\nSit more with your thoughts\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/J2uZvYX\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/J2uZvYX.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nAre you comfortable with just you and your thoughts, or do you need to constantly distract yourself from the inner workings of your own mind? We have to start re-connecting with our minds, and being more comfortable with just sitting with our thoughts\nTake a few days to ponder your thoughts, go with your feelings and think through them. Even write them down if you think it might help. We all need a healthy dose of self-reflection every now and then. We’re always so focused on moving forward in life that we forget to take a step back and let it all in.\nUsing Tech to Build Empathy\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/xtUxJZM\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xtUxJZM.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nOnline communication has created a space for people to openly speak their minds, which means they can vent anonymously with little fear of repercussion. Without having to see another human’s emotional feedback loop, some individuals feel emboldened to speak hatefully, create fear and spread mistrust. More than ever, we need to cultivate empathy as a society. \nUnderstanding the feelings of others is fundamental to communication and connection. However, experiencing empathy online can be more challenging than face-to-face communication, as you don’t get the immediate feedback of seeing someone’s facial expressions and body language. That is why learning to understand and communicate emotions in a digital context is an essential skill, and even more important given that the internet plays such an integral role in society.\nSubscribe!\nIf you enjoyed the podcast please subscribe and rate it.

Maria left her position as a teacher and took a chance to compete in the U.K.’s countrywide competition to become the British representative at the Miss Universe pageant. She wanted to break the stereotype and offer an alternative view to those who believe that beauty pageants are degrading. \nOur guest is dedicated to her mission to empower young women beyond the classroom, and Miss Universe is the perfect platform to do just that. Maria's experience as a teacher and tutor has alerted her to the harsh reality of what it’s like to be a young person searching for meaning in today’s world.\nOver the past decade, Maria has been researching and building a scientifically-driven parenting guide to ensure that our current generation of young people become the most inspiring future generation of leaders.

Just don’t let a single a goal dictate your life. Enjoy the pursuit of your goal with some diversions along the way. You need the ambition to keep you on track. But it should not close you off from others pursuing other paths even if they lead nowhere. Enjoy the path that leads you to your destination.\nIt’s important to look at all the good things in our lives and to enjoy them to the full right now. That is much more likely to bring happiness than waiting for it to appear around the corner.\nHave Courage\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/fqhVJU5\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fqhVJU5.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nCourage is not the absence of fear, but the strength to overcome it. Being courageous means being fully aware of the challenges and dangers ahead, feeling the fear associated with those challenges and dangers, and having the determination and drive to push through that fear and tackle them head-on.\nThe only thing that will help you feel more courageous is taking action, stepping outside your comfort zone, and sending yourself the message that you are a courageous person.\nDevelop a Growth Mindset\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/0hHH9vw\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0hHH9vw.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nA growth mindset is an idea that, with effort, it's possible to increase intelligence levels, talents, and abilities. Anyone who demonstrates a growth mindset believes their abilities develop over time, tend to seek out opportunities to gain new knowledge and broaden their skills, and do not typically shy away from challenges\nHaving a growth mindset is essential to lifelong success, and it is something that the youth can develop with practice at an early age.\nBonus Tip:\nEverything that you do is consciously or unconsciously driven by one of 6 human needs. These needs motivate and inspire us to take action in positive ways. However, when some of these needs are not met consistently, your mind will unconsciously find ways to satisfy these needs. How your mind does this is not always good for you and can lead to addictions.\nTony Robbins identified these 6 human needs and how they are behind everything that we do. If you have a behaviour that you can’t seem to stop, then it is likely that one of these 6 human needs is behind it.\n6 Human Needs\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/ImXG74q\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ImXG74q.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n1. Certainty\nWe all have a need for certainty, comfort, stability and security.\n2. Uncertainty/Variety\nWe all have a need for uncertainty, variety, excitement, and surprise.\n3. Significance\nWe all have a need to feel significant, special, unique, or important in some way.\n4. Love & Connection\nWe all have a need for love and connection.\n5. Growth\nWe all need to grow and evolve in some way.\n6. Contribution\nWe all need to contribute in some way so our lives have meaning.\nThe** first four needs** are the “needs of the personality” – you will meet these needs whether you know it or not.\nThe last two, “growth” and “contribution” are the_ spiritual needs_ – these are what bring us lasting fulfilment.\nSubscribe!\nIf you enjoyed the podcast please subscribe and rate it.

Just don’t let a single a goal dictate your life. Enjoy the pursuit of your goal with some diversions along the way. You need the ambition to keep you on track. But it should not close you off from others pursuing other paths even if they lead nowhere. Enjoy the path that leads you to your destination.</p>\n\n<p>It’s important to look at all the good things in our lives and to enjoy them to the full right now. That is much more likely to bring happiness than waiting for it to appear around the corner.</p>\n\n<h4>Have Courage</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/fqhVJU5\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fqhVJU5.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Courage is not the absence of fear, but the strength to overcome it. Being courageous means being fully aware of the challenges and dangers ahead, feeling the fear associated with those challenges and dangers, and having the determination and drive to push through that fear and tackle them head-on.</p>\n\n<p>The only thing that will help you feel more courageous is taking action, stepping outside your comfort zone, and sending yourself the message that you are a courageous person.</p>\n\n<h4>Develop a Growth Mindset</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/0hHH9vw\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0hHH9vw.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>A growth mindset is an idea that, with effort, it&#39;s possible to increase intelligence levels, talents, and abilities. Anyone who demonstrates a growth mindset believes their abilities develop over time, tend to seek out opportunities to gain new knowledge and broaden their skills, and do not typically shy away from challenges</p>\n\n<p>Having a growth mindset is essential to lifelong success, and it is something that the youth can develop with practice at an early age.</p>\n\n<h3>Bonus Tip:</h3>\n\n<p>Everything that you do is consciously or unconsciously driven by one of 6 human needs. These needs motivate and inspire us to take action in positive ways. However, when some of these needs are not met consistently, your mind will unconsciously find ways to satisfy these needs. How your mind does this is not always good for you and can lead to addictions.</p>\n\n<p>Tony Robbins identified these 6 human needs and how they are behind everything that we do. If you have a behaviour that you can’t seem to stop, then it is likely that one of these 6 human needs is behind it.</p>\n\n<h4>6 Human Needs</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/ImXG74q\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ImXG74q.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Certainty</strong><br>\nWe all have a need for certainty, comfort, stability and security.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Uncertainty/Variety</strong><br>\nWe all have a need for uncertainty, variety, excitement, and surprise.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Significance</strong><br>\nWe all have a need to feel significant, special, unique, or important in some way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Love &amp; Connection</strong><br>\nWe all have a need for love and connection.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Growth</strong><br>\nWe all need to grow and evolve in some way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Contribution</strong><br>\nWe all need to contribute in some way so our lives have meaning.</p>\n\n<p>The** first four needs** are the “<em>needs of the personality</em>” – you will meet these needs whether you know it or not.<br>\nThe <strong>last two</strong>, “growth” and “contribution” are the_ spiritual needs_ – these are what bring us lasting fulfilment.</p>\n\n<h2>Subscribe!</h2>\n\n<p>If you enjoyed the podcast please <strong><em>subscribe</em></strong> and <strong><em>rate it</em></strong>.

We just have to be mindful and choose to be happy. Happiness, like other emotions, is not something you obtain, but rather something you inhabit. \nWe also need to realize that Happiness coming from material things is just illusory, temporary, is not really happiness but just pleasure. If we chase happiness in material things, our pursue for happiness will never end.\nWhile many people try to look for happiness through their wealth, career, money and success, we have to understand that happiness is something that we choose for ourselves. Happiness is a choice and not a destination but a way to live our life.\nChange is Good\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/LwKAIv5\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LwKAIv5.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nYes, change is inevitable and it could be for the better. Change is liberating, healing, and just plain unavoidable. The more we welcome it, the more profoundly positive its impact on us can be.\nChange is the ultimate opportunity for transformation. When any great change happens, it’s a chance to do a reset.  It’s a chance for a fresh start.  It’s a chance to let things go.  It’s a chance to create a vision for the future.  It’s also a chance to reinvent yourself, which many times means bringing out more of who you are.\nIt’s best to adopt this truth sooner rather than later, as more change in life is always guaranteed.\nHere’s to new beginnings, and may big changes this year bring you great opportunity to renew, retool, and re-imagine what’s possible.\nListen to your Customers\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/afL55Ys\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/afL55Ys.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nHaving a comprehensive understanding of your customers better than they do is key.  The only way to understand the unique and dynamic customer purchasing journey is to put yourself in your customer’s shoes.\nHowever good your product or service is, the simple truth is that no-one will be part of your business if they don't want it or believe they don't need it. \nAfter all, if you don’t know who your customers are, you won’t know what they need.

So, just show up as you on day one. Be you so that you never have to be anyone else and the people that like you will do so authentically and those that don’t, well, they won’t stick around.</p>\n\n<p>Show up on day one as your authentic self and you’ll create an authentic life. Doing this will let you step into your power and be firm in your decisions and actions so that you can create the life you want</p>\n\n<p>This way, you can step into your power and be firm in those decisions and actions, so that you can create the life you want. When you do this, you’ll discover what I already know to be true about you, that you are amazing.</p>\n\n<h4>Be Persistent</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/d6bUrnV\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/d6bUrnV.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>It is never easy to foster talent. People will get discouraged and distracted. They may come to rely on you to do the heavy lifting, instead of demonstrating initiative and using their own intelligence. </p>\n\n<p>This is natural, because it takes time to discover one&#39;s own abilities. It also takes time to accept responsibility for one&#39;s own outcomes. You can help others, but it is not your role to do all the work for them. </p>\n\n<p>With persistence, you can communicate two critical lessons: you have talent burning inside you, and you can bring it out if you are willing to put in sufficient effort.</p>\n\n<h4>Learn to Listen</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/9aNdsDO\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9aNdsDO.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Listening is something you can learn, day after day, that enriches ourselves inwardly and outwardly we see in our demonstrations and in our behavior. It’s a gesture that shows maturity and security.</p>\n\n<p>While we are listening we often think already about how to respond. This is not a competition to see who is right, you do not win anything, actually you have everything to lose. If you do not handle well the conversation you risk misunderstandings and this leads to unnecessary fights. </p>\n\n<p>Do not listen to respond, listening to help, to understand, to learn and to grow together.</p>\n\n<h2>Subscribe!</h2>\n\n<p>If you enjoyed the podcast please <strong><em>subscribe</em></strong> and <strong><em>rate it</em></strong>.

If you look at what you don’t have in life, you’ll never have enough.” - Oprah Winfrey\nCreating an abundance mentality allows you to live an unlimited, full, and satisfying life. Train your mind to recognize the possibilities.\nThe brain can only absorb so much, so if your belief is “I can’t do it” or “it’s impossible” then any other thoughts contradicting that will get thrown out. Start training your mind to loosen its focus and create an expanded awareness.\nWith an abundance mindset, you dream and think big. You’re a lifelong learner who always takes opportunities to add to your knowledge and skill set. But it isn’t just about you. When those around you find success, your congratulations are sincere.\nStand Up for Yourself\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/7uMexhb\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7uMexhb.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nBe the change\nEvery day we make dozens of little choices that either benefit us by asserting our ideas or diminish us because we hesitate in making our views or desires known.\nStanding up for yourself can be difficult. Whether in the context of business, or social interactions, a person needs to be sure that they are speaking up on their own behalf. You’ve got to have your voice, thoughts and emotions understood by those around you.\nSometimes it seems easier to go with the flow to avoid potential conflict. But the truth is that letting people walk all over you can increase feelings of stress and anxiety, and it might eventually lessen your feelings of self-worth and play to your insecurities.\nLearning to stand up for yourself will help you take charge of your life, believe in your own power and embolden you to reach for your dreams. The stronger you feel, the stronger you will become.\nMusic Always Helps\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/r27fDnw\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/r27fDnw.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nMusic can soothe the brokenhearted, motivate runners and kickoff the most epic dance parties\nThe notion that music can influence your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors probably do not come as much of a surprise. If you've ever felt pumped up while listening to your favorite fast-paced rock anthem or been moved to tears by a tender live performance, then you easily understand the power of music to impact moods and even inspire action.\nMusic has been proven to help our bodies heal, improve memory, alleviate stress and more.

The way this works is really simple: Just add a lead-generating call-to-action to every blog post. Often, these calls-to-action lead to any content asset for which someone would be willing to exchange their information.\nBlogging also helps you get discovered via social media. Every time you write a blog post, you're creating content that people can share on social networks - Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Pinterest - which helps expose your business to a new audience that may not know you yet.\nOrganic Marketing will be the Future\nOrganic marketing is  any marketing piece you create that is not promoted on an advertising medium - blogs, videos, whitepapers, social media posts, slide shares, etc.\nOrganic marketing is best used to develop brand voice, enable authentic interactions with customers, educate and convert blog readers, and drive traffic to landing pages, your website, and other online assets.\nIt differs from Advertising because you do not pay to be on a medium. With organic marketing you can reach 5 people up to 3 billion. It really is unlimited. And no guidlines needed for you conent. Just make sure to not damage your brand with over-the-top content.\nNever Give Up\nLife is ever evolving; circumstances keep changing – sometimes very good, at times average and other times very harsh and difficult.\nIt is impossible to reach success without first failing a few times, so don’t let anything stop you from persisting. Nobody is programmed to be successful at the first try, that is why failure is a normal process in life. Failure is not the end but just a feedback to you suggesting that you change the method or the direction.\nWe all know of failure to success stories or the rise to fame lives of celebrities. Though these stories may looks like an overnight success but in reality success is always preceded by years of struggle, persistence and hard work. Instant success is a myth. Ask yourself, does it make sense to give up ?\nSuccess does not come easily to people. To achieve such worthwhile and precious things require positive thoughts, self-control, deep commitment, regular action, high level of self-sacrifice, and a willingness to put in a lot of effort over a long period of time.\nSubscribe!\nIf you enjoyed the podcast please subscribe and rate it.

It can chip away at our pride, make us question our own abilities, sometimes create paralyzing anxiety, and yes, sometimes, to some people, make us appear weak. But it doesn’t have to. Because asking for help can also do something else — it can help us create better results.\nConfident people often ask others for help, not only because they’re secure enough to let it be known they need help but they know that trying to do everything themselves is not always the best use of their time, skills or energy and that it can leave them feeling overwhelmed and stressed and then they can’t do things properly. \nConfident people find someone who’s good at what they need to learn or get done and then ask for their help and guidance. They know that asking, ‘Can you help me?’ shows respect for the other person’s knowledge and abilities. Otherwise, they wouldn’t ask.\nRefusing to ask for help is counter-productive; you’re more likely to berate yourself when you can’t get it done well or on time, which only serves to knock your self-esteem and confidence further.\nBuild a network\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/BV4LgFw\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BV4LgFw.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nActive networking is vital to career growth. Networking is all about building long-term relationships and a good reputation over time. It involves meeting and getting to know people who you can assist and who can potentially help you in return. Your network includes everyone from friends and family to work colleagues and members of groups to which you belong.\nThe most obvious benefit of networking is to meet potential clients and/or generate referrals which you can then follow up on to hopefully add to your client base. Networking can also help you identify opportunities for partnerships, joint ventures, or new areas of expansion for your business. \nIn addition to the potential of increasing your business you can often find solutions to your own business problems or needs by networking.\nLive life to the fullest\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/wSi8tmk\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/wSi8tmk.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nNo matter who a person is, what they are currently doing, how much money they have in the bank, and so on, everyone can start living life to the fullest.\nYou just never know what may happen in the future, so taking advantage of the time you have now is very important. No one ever wants their life to flash before their eyes and wonder whether their life was meaningful or not, whether they had a good time, or whether they regret past decisions.\nBe open to new things and tackle your fears.\nWhen was the last time you did something new? So many people live inside their comfort zone when they actually need to branch out every now and then.\nYes, stepping outside of your box can be tough, but what if it completely opened your eyes and changed your whole outlook on life? Wouldn’t that be amazing?\nIf you want to learn how to live life to the fullest, this is something you need to do every now and then. You could even give yourself a goal to try something new each day, each week, or each month\nSubscribe!\nIf you enjoyed the podcast please subscribe and rate it.

I am a British entrepreneur, investor and explorer. From hitchhiking across Kazakstan to programming AI doctors I am always pushing myself in the spirit of curiosity and Growth. My background is in Biology and Psychology with a passion for improving the world and human behaviour. I have built and sold companies from an early age and love coming up with unique ways to make life more enjoyable and meaningful.\nSam:\nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/samjamsnaps/)\nQuora (https://www.quora.com/profile/Sam-Harris-58)\nTwitter (https://twitter.com/samharristweets)\nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharris48/)\nSam's blog - SamWebsterHarris.com (https://samwebsterharris.com/)\nSupport the Show - Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/growthmindset)\nEpisode Summary\nBen had a hard time with ball sports which led him to try out rowing. He fancied the sport and grew to love it.\nat school I rowed simply because I couldn't catch a cricket ball or hit one. So I rowed, cause I just hated ball sports cause I was rubbish\nOur guest went to school but found himself choosing the sport he loves than completing a college degree. \n**I started civil engineering. The next year I started a different degree. I started time planning cause I failed my first year civil engineering and people told me to, planning was easy at about six weeks in, they wanted me to hand some work in which clearly I hadn't done on.\nThe head coach was saying, right, you've got a chance again to the Olympics. Do you want to study or do you want to row? So that was perfect.\nBack in the day, there was not much money with rowing or sports in general. Ben was challenged to come up with money to support his financial needs as an athlete.\nThose days, most people  rode for a kind of limited amount of time because you got to get on with life and there's no money in it.   in 97 John major started the national lottery with the aim that a lot of the money went to sport and then it changed\nBen was able to share his training regimen as a rower and how his diet was.\nWe trained seven days a week and we were doing between 15 and 21 training sessions a week. Training sessions varied from two hours to an hour, probably\nate about 7,000 calories a day.\nBen talks about how he views sacrifices as a choice, Explaining how he chose to train for his goal rather than spending his time partying, getting drunk, which would cost him a training session.\nI'm not sure how many sacrifices I made because I just did what I wanted to do. There are people quite often will say, what did you give up? Or how many sacrifices (you made), and I'm just not sure I made many cause I think a sacrifice is where you give up doing what you want to do to do something else. And actually what I wanted to do was train hard\nBen also talks about how working hard is not enough. Working hard must be accompanied by working smart. This allows one to assess their performance to reach their goal.\nI thought then that working hard was the answer. If I worked hard enough, it would be all right rather than if I learned fast. And the change that happened in the last two years, my rowing career was, it was learning, but where we were just ruthless about making sure we were learning from every session rather than just working hard. And I wish I have started learning earlier in my rowing career cause I think I probably could've done better\nOur guest chimes in to what growth mindsert means to him and how to properly process a growth mindset.\nAll the stuff about growth mindset about continuous improvement, right? The theory behind is all really, really simple common sense  but common sense isn't common practice  and it's actually really hard to do. Reviewing every single thing, every single session you do, meeting you, come at all. What worked? What didn't, what do I do better tomorrow? You need to know what you're good at so you can repeat it.\nBen mentions how one should be aware of their strengths and weaknesses and choose to focus on the thing that would allow the \"boat to go faster.\" \nWe couldn't control winning. All we could do was control boat speed. So therefore, boat speed was the most important thing. So therefore we had to do stuff that would make the boat go faster.\nAfter Ben's rowing career, he had married and was not able to calculate his next step as if he was enjoying life at the moment. It took Ben 5 months before finding employment and had to work hard to make a respectable name for himself.

He fancied the sport and grew to love it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>at school I rowed simply because I couldn&#39;t catch a cricket ball or hit one. So I rowed, cause I just hated ball sports cause I was rubbish</strong></p>\n\n<p>Our guest went to school but found himself choosing the sport he loves than completing a college degree. </p>\n\n<p>**I started civil engineering. The next year I started a different degree. I started time planning cause I failed my first year civil engineering and people told me to, planning was easy at about six weeks in, they wanted me to hand some work in which clearly I hadn&#39;t done on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The head coach was saying, right, you&#39;ve got a chance again to the Olympics. Do you want to study or do you want to row? So that was perfect.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Back in the day, there was not much money with rowing or sports in general. Ben was challenged to come up with money to support his financial needs as an athlete.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Those days, most people  rode for a kind of limited amount of time because you got to get on with life and there&#39;s no money in it.   in 97 John major started the national lottery with the aim that a lot of the money went to sport and then it changed</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ben was able to share his training regimen as a rower and how his diet was.</p>\n\n<p><strong>We trained seven days a week and we were doing between 15 and 21 training sessions a week. Training sessions varied from two hours to an hour, probably</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>ate about 7,000 calories a day.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ben talks about how he views sacrifices as a choice, Explaining how he chose to train for his goal rather than spending his time partying, getting drunk, which would cost him a training session.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I&#39;m not sure how many sacrifices I made because I just did what I wanted to do. There are people quite often will say, what did you give up? Or how many sacrifices (you made), and I&#39;m just not sure I made many cause I think a sacrifice is where you give up doing what you want to do to do something else. And actually what I wanted to do was train hard</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ben also talks about how working hard is not enough. Working hard must be accompanied by working smart. This allows one to assess their performance to reach their goal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I thought then that working hard was the answer. If I worked hard enough, it would be all right rather than if I learned fast. And the change that happened in the last two years, my rowing career was, it was learning, but where we were just ruthless about making sure we were learning from every session rather than just working hard. And I wish I have started learning earlier in my rowing career cause I think I probably could&#39;ve done better</strong></p>\n\n<p>Our guest chimes in to what growth mindsert means to him and how to properly process a growth mindset.</p>\n\n<p><strong>All the stuff about growth mindset about continuous improvement, right? The theory behind is all really, really simple common sense  but common sense isn&#39;t common practice  and it&#39;s actually really hard to do. Reviewing every single thing, every single session you do, meeting you, come at all. What worked? What didn&#39;t, what do I do better tomorrow? You need to know what you&#39;re good at so you can repeat it.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Ben mentions how one should be aware of their strengths and weaknesses and choose to focus on the thing that would allow the &quot;boat to go faster.&quot; </p>\n\n<p><strong>We couldn&#39;t control winning. All we could do was control boat speed. So therefore, boat speed was the most important thing. So therefore we had to do stuff that would make the boat go faster.</strong></p>\n\n<p>After Ben&#39;s rowing career, he had married and was not able to calculate his next step as if he was enjoying life at the moment. It took Ben 5 months before finding employment and had to work hard to make a respectable name for himself. Ben avoided using the story of being an Olympian gold medal winner to gauge himself on whethere he was good enough.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I had no plan past my wedding day. I thought that I&#39;d stopped competing after Sydney, and as soon as I crossed the line, I knew that was it. But what came next? I had no idea. And at that point, I was 28 I&#39;d never had a job.</strong></p>\n\n<p>*<em>I wanted to be good at the job for being good at the job rather than what I&#39;d done before. *</em></p>\n\n<p>Ben explains bullshit filters as a way for him and the rowing team to mute outside noises that could distract them from their goal which was to win.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When I was rowing, we came up with this thing, bullshit filters about kind of these imaginary or defenders, you can Mark them up to maximum deflection and the bullshit just wouldn&#39;t get through.

Having graduated from Stanford with a PhD in computer science back in 2014, his research area is the intersection of natural language processing and human-computer interaction.\nLearn why Spence decided on this field of technology and why he thinks that it is important for the corporate businesses across the globe who have to resort to other means of language translation. He works to remove the cross-language barriers hindering significant progress for people. \nWhen you’re a business, you want to translate something. You hire one of these companies from the language industry and they hire a bunch of freelancers. You give them the words and they hire these people and they translate the words and they give it back to you. And it’s slow and inefficient. And this is kind of the main reason why more stuff doesn’t get translated. It’s expensive. So, we started to build systems to make that process more efficient. And that’s what we do now. So, we build this system that institutions who these are businesses, governments and academic institutions can use to publish information across language barriers and do that in a much more efficient way.\nHe explains what he does in simple words for the audience and then explains the scope that this research has in different domains.\nIn our field we’re in natural language processing, which is some discipline of artificial intelligence, which is a sub discipline of computer science.\nSpence also elaborates how getting a chance to work at Google Translate was a significant and unexpected career opportunity for him – almost an adventure. \nIt’s a complicated technology to build that requires in the early days we need to do level people to build the system. And they’re not that many of those people in the world and most of them work for tech companies for very large salaries.\nHe shares what allowed him to convince people from different fields to take the risk to join his start-up company.\nIt’s less my ability to sell or persuade and more how interesting and important the problem in the mission is. And good scientists and engineers are attracted to hard problems. So, if you have heart problems to solve, that’s probably the best thing that you can do to attract great people. \nSpence also has much to say about what his company has been doing for the past few years and what the business processes and mechanisms are.\nThe process for the last couple of years, is positioning the product in the market so it solves a specific business need. It’s presented in a way that people can understand. You can compare to what they their existing solutions to the problem. It’s priced in way that people understand, and they can get through their procurement departments.\nSpencer says that he finds comfort in knowing that his human experience is not unique and the problem that he’s facing, other people have faced and solved. And oftentimes, if you have a good mentor or if you’re surrounded by people who have seen more of the film than you have, then you can focus on solving original problems and not resolving problems.\nSomebody told me a long time ago that a CEO has three responsibilities. People, culture and vision and not running out of cash. And those are kind of a unique things that a CEO can do. And I think that people and culture part that has a lot to do with being able to hire well and then being able to articulate expectations for how you want to mobilize a group of people to work together. And a lot of that is being a very good communicator.\nHe also explains what he expects from the field and the industry overall in the coming few years and how it is going to impact people. \nWorkload will move to machines. I’m less of an optimist. I guess that the entire field will be fully automated and there’s some sort of dystopian future where nobody has a job anymore. I think that’s not really the history of technology, really. The history of technology is you mechanized things that can be mechanized and that frees people up to work on higher order problems. Maybe that’s not true in places like, I don’t know, the copy shop in a business and now you have a printer and you don’t need a copy person.\nHaving been a project manager, he also emphasizes the importance of a manager for organizational performance and the impact that he has. \nA manager as an individual contributor – you go from assessing your own performance in terms of your individual output to being an organization leader and your performance is the output of your organization.\nKey Discussion Points\n[7:50] The importance of automated translators and removal of cross-language barriers.\n[12:04] How they convinced people to take the risk to join a start-up\n[15:53] Importance of having good mentors\n[17:35] Strategies that Spence and his company are currently using.\n[21:33] Developing into an effective CEO\n[28:45] The future of the industry and its impact on people.\n[34:54] Two books by Peter Drucker that guide and inspire our guest – “The Effective Executive” and “Management.”\nTop Tips\nOvercoming the language barrier through technology\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/KxrNifz\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/KxrNifz.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nWe live in an era of rapid globalization, which is demonstrated by the growing demand for language services. Translation technology solves this problem in two ways. First, it enables translation at a level where it does not need to involve a human. Secondly, we’ve seen translation technology increase human translator productivity.\nUltimately, translation is important because it facilitates multilingual communication and allows people from around the world to better understand one another culturally, economically and socially.\nTranslation technology is just getting to the point where the general public will start to see its impact in their everyday lives. Not only are there free, general translation engines online, but even the more tailored, advanced technology is becoming accessible\nHaving a good mentor by your side\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/tRg9TAk\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/tRg9TAk.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nA good mentor is willing and able to take you on. A good mentor iwill help you stay accountable to your goals, they will help you pay attention and stay on track. A mentor essentially fills those gaps that are missing from your career and professional development growth.\nIf you are lucky enough to find a personal mentor who can be all of these things to you, you will gain an advantage, because you have a secret weapon that can take you to new heights.\nLead by example\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/D7kpV8v\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/D7kpV8v.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n\"A leader knows the way, goes the way and shows the way\" -John Maxwell\nLead a team honestly and authentically. Make sure you \"walk the walk.\" When leaders don't \"practice what they preach,\" it can be almost impossible for a team to work together successfully. How can anyone trust a leader who talks about one thing, but does another?\nGood leadership takes strength of character and a firm commitment to do the right thing, at the right time, for the right reason. This means doing what you say, when you say it. If your team knows that you'll also do whatever you expect from them, they'll likely work hard to help you achieve your goal.\nBooks\nGet any of the books free on audible (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00OPA2XFG?tag=samharris48%E2%80%9321)\nThe Effective Executive - Peter Drucker (https://www.amazon.com/dp/0060833459/?tag=devonfir-20)\nManaging Oneself: The Key to Success - Peter Drucker (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Managing-Oneself-Peter-F-Drucker/dp/163369304X/ref=sr_1_4?crid=106CDRCKL3IAY&keywords=peter+drucker&qid=1581614768&sprefix=peter+dru%2Caps%2C404&sr=8-4)\nIntroduction to Deep Learning (The MIT Press) (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Deep-Learning-MIT-Press/dp/0262039516/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=charniak&qid=1581614712&s=books&sr=8-1)\nSubscribe!\nIf you enjoyed the podcast please subscribe and rate it.

Having graduated from Stanford with a PhD in computer science back in 2014, his research area is the intersection of natural language processing and human-computer interaction.</p>\n\n<p>Learn why Spence decided on this field of technology and why he thinks that it is important for the corporate businesses across the globe who have to resort to other means of language translation. He works to remove the cross-language barriers hindering significant progress for people. </p>\n\n<p><strong>When you’re a business, you want to translate something. You hire one of these companies from the language industry and they hire a bunch of freelancers. You give them the words and they hire these people and they translate the words and they give it back to you. And it’s slow and inefficient. And this is kind of the main reason why more stuff doesn’t get translated. It’s expensive. So, we started to build systems to make that process more efficient. And that’s what we do now. So, we build this system that institutions who these are businesses, governments and academic institutions can use to publish information across language barriers and do that in a much more efficient way.</strong></p>\n\n<p>He explains what he does in simple words for the audience and then explains the scope that this research has in different domains.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In our field we’re in natural language processing, which is some discipline of artificial intelligence, which is a sub discipline of computer science.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Spence also elaborates how getting a chance to work at Google Translate was a significant and unexpected career opportunity for him – almost an adventure. </p>\n\n<p><strong>It’s a complicated technology to build that requires in the early days we need to do level people to build the system. And they’re not that many of those people in the world and most of them work for tech companies for very large salaries.</strong></p>\n\n<p>He shares what allowed him to convince people from different fields to take the risk to join his start-up company.</p>\n\n<p><strong>It’s less my ability to sell or persuade and more how interesting and important the problem in the mission is. And good scientists and engineers are attracted to hard problems. So, if you have heart problems to solve, that’s probably the best thing that you can do to attract great people.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Spence also has much to say about what his company has been doing for the past few years and what the business processes and mechanisms are.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The process for the last couple of years, is positioning the product in the market so it solves a specific business need. It’s presented in a way that people can understand. You can compare to what they their existing solutions to the problem. It’s priced in way that people understand, and they can get through their procurement departments.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Spencer says that he finds comfort in knowing that his human experience is not unique and the problem that he’s facing, other people have faced and solved. And oftentimes, if you have a good mentor or if you’re surrounded by people who have seen more of the film than you have, then you can focus on solving original problems and not resolving problems.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Somebody told me a long time ago that a CEO has three responsibilities. People, culture and vision and not running out of cash. And those are kind of a unique things that a CEO can do. And I think that people and culture part that has a lot to do with being able to hire well and then being able to articulate expectations for how you want to mobilize a group of people to work together. And a lot of that is being a very good communicator.</strong></p>\n\n<p>He also explains what he expects from the field and the industry overall in the coming few years and how it is going to impact people. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Workload will move to machines. I’m less of an optimist. I guess that the entire field will be fully automated and there’s some sort of dystopian future where nobody has a job anymore. I think that’s not really the history of technology, really. The history of technology is you mechanized things that can be mechanized and that frees people up to work on higher order problems. Maybe that’s not true in places like, I don’t know, the copy shop in a business and now you have a printer and you don’t need a copy person.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Having been a project manager, he also emphasizes the importance of a manager for organizational performance and the impact that he has. </p>\n\n<p><strong>A manager as an individual contributor – you go from assessing your own performance in terms of your individual output to being an organization leader and your performance is the output of your organization.</strong></p>\n\n<h3>Key Discussion Points</h3>\n\n<p><strong>[7:50]</strong> The importance of automated translators and removal of cross-language barriers.<br>\n<strong>[12:04]</strong> How they convinced people to take the risk to join a start-up<br>\n<strong>[15:53]</strong> Importance of having good mentors<br>\n<strong>[17:35]</strong> Strategies that Spence and his company are currently using.<br>\n<strong>[21:33]</strong> Developing into an effective CEO<br>\n<strong>[28:45]</strong> The future of the industry and its impact on people.<br>\n<strong>[34:54]</strong> Two books by Peter Drucker that guide and inspire our guest – <em>“The Effective Executive”</em> and <em>“Management.”</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Top Tips</h3>\n\n<h4>Overcoming the language barrier through technology</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/KxrNifz\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/KxrNifz.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>We live in an era of rapid globalization, which is demonstrated by the growing demand for language services. Translation technology solves this problem in two ways. First, it enables translation at a level where it does not need to involve a human. Secondly, we’ve seen translation technology increase human translator productivity.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, translation is important because it facilitates multilingual communication and allows people from around the world to better understand one another culturally, economically and socially.</p>\n\n<p>Translation technology is just getting to the point where the general public will start to see its impact in their everyday lives. Not only are there free, general translation engines online, but even the more tailored, advanced technology is becoming accessible</p>\n\n<h4>Having a good mentor by your side</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/tRg9TAk\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/tRg9TAk.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>A good mentor is willing and able to take you on. A good mentor iwill help you stay accountable to your goals, they will help you pay attention and stay on track. A mentor essentially fills those gaps that are missing from your career and professional development growth.</p>\n\n<p>If you are lucky enough to find a personal mentor who can be all of these things to you, you will gain an advantage, because you have a secret weapon that can take you to new heights.</p>\n\n<h4>Lead by example</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/D7kpV8v\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/D7kpV8v.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;A leader knows the way, goes the way and shows the way&quot;</em> -John Maxwell</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Lead a team honestly and authentically. Make sure you &quot;walk the walk.&quot; When leaders don&#39;t &quot;practice what they preach,&quot; it can be almost impossible for a team to work together successfully. How can anyone trust a leader who talks about one thing, but does another?</p>\n\n<p>Good leadership takes strength of character and a firm commitment to do the right thing, at the right time, for the right reason. This means doing what you say, when you say it. If your team knows that you&#39;ll also do whatever you expect from them, they&#39;ll likely work hard to help you achieve your goal.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Books</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00OPA2XFG?tag=samharris48%E2%80%9321\" rel=\"nofollow\">Get any of the books free on audible</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0060833459/?tag=devonfir-20\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Effective Executive - Peter Drucker</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Managing-Oneself-Peter-F-Drucker/dp/163369304X/ref=sr_1_4?crid=106CDRCKL3IAY&keywords=peter+drucker&qid=1581614768&sprefix=peter+dru%2Caps%2C404&sr=8-4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Managing Oneself: The Key to Success - Peter Drucker</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Deep-Learning-MIT-Press/dp/0262039516/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=charniak&qid=1581614712&s=books&sr=8-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Introduction to Deep Learning (The MIT Press)</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Subscribe!</h2>\n\n<p>If you enjoyed the podcast please <strong><em>subscribe</em></strong> and <strong><em>rate it</em></strong>.

I have built and sold companies from an early age and love coming up with unique ways to make life more enjoyable and meaningful.\nSam:\nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/samjamsnaps/)\nQuora (https://www.quora.com/profile/Sam-Harris-58)\nTwitter (https://twitter.com/samharristweets)\nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharris48/)\nSam's blog - SamWebsterHarris.com (https://samwebsterharris.com/)\nSupport the Show - Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/growthmindset)\nEpisode Summary\nFrom having moved to Baghdad at the age of five and sold goods to survive at the age of eleven, Francis progressed to become the seasoned and expert technologist that he is now. \nLearn how our guest suffered through the time he spent in Iraq and what it was like to be in such a country during wartime. He also explains why he always thought of moving out due to his rebellious nature. \nI was thinking, well, I’m going to move out of this country because this is this is not how I want to live. So, I was pretty much very rebellious, had a long hair and, you know, play guitar, and I just want to have a free society. \nFrancis expresses his beliefs and explains why it is important for him. How he was raised, how his faith influenced his life, and what he thinks about having faith. \nI believe that you have to have faith. You have to believe in something that is greater than you.\nHe also emphasizes the importance of faith in the modern world and explains how it works today compared to how it used to be back then\nEven in the system we have right now, the environment we have in this world. People believing in something. And it doesn’t matter what’s right and wrong, they don’t rationalize.\nOur guest also has much to share with the audience in terms of different political systems and how they impact people’s routine lives.\nThe way people look at political figures and politics in general is a bit stupid and you should definitely think more about what it is that you want rather than being on team or team B intensity of fighting over something that doesn’t even matter.\nHaving moved across different political and social systems while moving from Iraq to Sweden to the United States, Francis has learned much and more. How different countries varied in terms of the freedom offered to citizens. \nI enjoy that free society, but also, I enjoy the kind of the structure in Sweden. I mean, the way they are thinking, the way they build their system in terms of the society, in terms of the welfare system.\nOur guest also helps us develop an outlook of abundance towards life – how lives of the people from all financial and social classes have improved over time and what we take for granted now is what was considered prestigious back then. \nAll the things that we’re used to are the kind of things that people didn’t have. If you move years ago, you kind of feel like shit healthcare and like horrible food and so on. \nOur guest also explains how he started his businesses and what he has learned from his experience in the corporate world. \nThis is one of that Steve Jobs’ philosophy. You know that you don’t hire people, that you tell them what you do. You have to hire smart people to tell you what to do.\nHe also shares valuable insight on open VPN and cloud technologies – how they evolved and where they are expected to be in the coming years. \nWe’re going to be launching a new product by the end of the year. It’s our own cloud and that’s targeting almost all businesses. And the idea of that cloud is really to build another secure layer on top of the Internet that you can construct Europe network. I call it VPN on demand. So, on demand, you would be able to do side to side. You would be able to do remote access. You would be able to do a lot of things on the basically online and on the web, pretty much. But we have the infrastructure to do allow you to build. It’s like a toolbox. But it’s really on the cloud itself to allow you to interconnect, you know, all the resources, all the sites you have your users and provide access, control and provide the level of security.\nHe also explains how he hires people for his company and how he incentivizes people to join them while being transparent and straightforward as well. Being a CEO, he knows much and more about the running of a company and its leadership. \nFor us, it’s very hard because there are a lot of these people who can work for bigger companies, but they can’t work for us because they really have to take the initiative to do things. And we make it very clear to them, here is what we’re doing. This is what we have. This is a technology. This is where our vision is. So, we have to treat this as a sales job, too. I mean, as a CEO, you are really a salesperson all the time because you have to sell your idea even to the people you’re hiring.\nHe also explains why the security provided by VPN and cloud is important to companies and what role it plays for them. \nFrom a security perspective, I believe VPN is going to play that role in terms of being the connectivity layers that that tunnelling layer that you can connect all these devices into a network.\nGain valuable insight on all the aspects of technological advancements – the good and the bad. It facilitates the good deeds as well as the bad deeds. \n*When you distribute things and you make it peer to peer, then the bad actors come in and take advantage of the technology. And you will see a lot of and you’re seeing already, you know, a lot of frauds, a lot of problems that comes along with it to get some more random questions. *\nTop Tips\nStarting Multiple Businesses\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/xkkNLOy\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xkkNLOy.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nOwning multiple companies create a great deal of complexity as well as sometimes pitfalls. However the benefits can be many things. If you have businesses that complement each other very commonly we can save each other money. \nFor example, if you have businesses of complementary services, sometimes you may be able to use one company to recruit clients for another. If you were a marketing company, you could use your video production company or artist representation company to help your clients make commercials (you may also be able to take lower revenue on each as you are getting both sides of the transaction. This may lower your price so you can improve your bids and get more clients.)\nYou don’t have to be a millionaire or an influential person to consider running more than one business, although a large budget would probably make it easier!\nIt is certainly possible to run multiple businesses successfully, but it requires organisation and discipline to do so.\nNot Fearing Failure\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/yMSyt5l\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yMSyt5l.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nFear of failure is a significant obstacle that stands between you and your goals. But it doesn’t have to be.\nFear of failure is the intense worry you experience when you imagine all the horrible things that could happen if you failed to achieve a goal. The intense worry increases the odds of holding back or giving up. Being successful relies to a large extent on your ability to leverage fear.\nStart by setting small goals that will help build your confidence. Learn how to explore and evaluate all possible outcomes rationally and develop contingency plans; and practice thinking positively. By moving forward slowly but steadily, you'll begin to overcome your fear.\nSurround Yourself with the Best and Leverage\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/99UN7Xm\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/99UN7Xm.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nLeadership is a team sport.  It is not about what one person does, but instead the cumulative actions of everyone in an organization. \nThe best leaders surround themselves with intrinsically motivated individuals who will not only perform at a high level with little oversight but will also push the leader to reflect and grow continually. \nSteve Jobs famously said, \n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/H44ZcLS\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/H44ZcLS.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n“It doesn’t make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.”\nDepending on others for guidance and wisdom is not a sign of weakness. On the contrary, it a definitive sign of strength. Effective leadership relies on making smart decisions. Make it easy on yourself. Hire or surround yourself with smart people, get out of their way, and don’t be afraid to let them “tell” you what to do.\nSubscribe!\nIf you enjoyed the podcast please subscribe and rate it.

I am a British entrepreneur, investor and explorer. From hitchhiking across Kazakstan to programming AI doctors I am always pushing myself in the spirit of curiosity and Growth. My background is in Biology and Psychology with a passion for improving the world and human behaviour. I have built and sold companies from an early age and love coming up with unique ways to make life more enjoyable and meaningful.\nSam:\nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/samjamsnaps/)\nQuora (https://www.quora.com/profile/Sam-Harris-58)\nTwitter (https://twitter.com/samharristweets)\nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharris48/)\nSam's blog - SamWebsterHarris.com (https://samwebsterharris.com/)\nSupport the Show - Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/growthmindset)\nTop Tips\nTip #1 - Listen, Listen, Listen\nListen to the guest, don’t fill your head with what you want to say next because, in reality, it will be a response to something they haven’t said yet.\nGood listening allows us to demonstrate that we are paying attention to the thoughts, feelings and behaviours of the other person (seeing the world through their eyes). \nThis is crucial to maintaining productive relationships, and sometimes the only way to establish communication.\nTip#2 - Make Notes but Try Not to have a Load of Questions\nDon’t pack multiple questions into one unless they are closely related. They can be confusing, especially if the guest has a lot to say. Ask your questions one at a time as you would in natural conversation.\nTip#3 - Ask Interesting Questions\nBasic questions are a no-no\nAvoid asking basic questions. Asking basic questions make it seem like you don’t know the person you’re interviewing. \nThese are bad: “What are you best known for?” or “What book are you promoting?” Instead, set up good questions by establishing a premise or hypothesis beforehand\nTip#4 - Recursive Questions\nRecursion is a challenging concept. If you're a programmer, then you would have an idea of where I am going. If you don't, I'm happy to explain to you how this goes.\nBeing able to think recursively is very important because solving a problem with recursion is cleaner and easier to implement. It can also be used to break down problems into smaller components — a recursive pattern known as Divide and Conquer.\nUnderstanding how asking recursive questions is, this strategy allows you to provide different angles for listeners by opening doors that could lead to an insightful conversation with your guest.\nBonus Tip #1- Encourage Healthy Debates\nBonus Tip #2 - Find Inspiring Role Models\nBonus Tip #3 - Consider your Guest's Feeling Towards a Personal Topic\nHoping these tips, which are quite different from what you'll hear or read, help aspiring and experienced podcasters alike be better at their craft of interviewing or conversing, in general.\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/V6RbuxX\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/V6RbuxX.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nSubscribe!\nIf you enjoyed the podcast please subscribe and rate it.

If you&#39;re a programmer, then you would have an idea of where I am going. If you don&#39;t, I&#39;m happy to explain to you how this goes.</p>\n\n<p>Being able to think recursively is very important because solving a problem with recursion is cleaner and easier to implement. It can also be used to break down problems into smaller components — a recursive pattern known as Divide and Conquer.</p>\n\n<p>Understanding how asking recursive questions is, this strategy allows you to provide different angles for listeners by opening doors that could lead to an insightful conversation with your guest.</p>\n\n<h4>Bonus Tip #1- Encourage Healthy Debates</h4>\n\n<h4>Bonus Tip #2 - Find Inspiring Role Models</h4>\n\n<h4>Bonus Tip #3 - Consider your Guest&#39;s Feeling Towards a Personal Topic</h4>\n\n<p>Hoping these tips, which are quite different from what you&#39;ll hear or read, help aspiring and experienced podcasters alike be better at their craft of interviewing or conversing, in general.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/V6RbuxX\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/V6RbuxX.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<h2>Subscribe!</h2>\n\n<p>If you enjoyed the podcast please <strong><em>subscribe</em></strong> and <strong><em>rate it</em></strong>.

You can create literally anything you want that you're passionate about. You have to take charge of your path, own your differences, and cultivate habits that will allow you to succeed in any environment.\nStay Curious\nEven if you are not sure what you want to do, pay attention to what you love. If you have an expansive curiosity, don’t feel pressured. At the same time, you will need a clear vision to guide your career and give it forward momentum. \nMan up, or shall I say, Woman up!\nOnce you’ve found your own theme, try to get exposure to every aspect of that industry or process. Even if your career path seems unclear, your  talents and interest could one day bloom into something truly amazing.\nThe mindset is you got to learn to figure stuff out\"<\nThe Future of Technology is both Promising and Scary\nTechnology has made a tremendous improvement in our lives. It’s hard to function in today’s society without some knowledge of the Internet and computers in general. \nTechnology has changed the ways of education and learning, by providing us the information and data we need in a matter of seconds. But, when it comes to technological advances, people seem to split into two groups:\nThe first one being those who are excited about what the future might hold, and the second one — those who are gravely concerned about the possible dangers of new technologies.\nSeveral controversial topics has been talked about in the technological field. These are CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats), Nanotechnology, DARPA's military research and even BCI. These advancements bring up a number of ethical issues worth questioning:\nEthical and regulatory challenges\nRobots as intelligent as humans\nNeurohacking\n And much more\nAll in all, the way technology will affect our future depends solely on us. For now, let’s enjoy the present and work towards making a better future for the next generations to come.\nGet Comfortable Being Uncomfortable\nDoing stuff alone, being with yourself and learning who you are, would be helpful points in being comfortable with yourself. \n Put yourself in as many uncomfortable situations until you find your silver lining. Don’t be afraid to be selfish. It might just make you a better person.\nShow Notes\nThe Knowledge Society\nTKS was started by two brothers, Navid and Nadeem Nathoo, who wanted to create what they wish they had growing upm which is to develop the next-generation of activators that will solve the world's most important problems\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/ArRe6Ts\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ArRe6Ts.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nIf we can train Olympic level athletes from a young age, why can't we train Olympic level CEOs and innovators?< \nSchooling\nShifra was actually part of the an Ivy league for 2 years and transitioned to an online school and TKS full-time.\nIt's all about getting unconventional success by taking an unconventional path<\nThe way the system works just isn't optimized for that (unconventional success). But how do you actually begin to optimize for that<\nUnicorn People\nShifra explains Unicorn people in a similar concept of a unicorn company (a privately held startup company valued at over $1 billion), this is a person who impacts over 1 billion people. And most curiculums in convetional schools does not teach how an individual can impact a billion people.\nTo stay on top, you have to do things the majority of people don’t do. People considered as such are  Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Nikola Tesla, and Albert Einstein, to name a few.\nEmpathy on the Scientific Field\nIn terms of Ethics, scientific ethics calls for honesty and integrity in all stages of scientific practice. From reporting results regardless to properly attributing collaborators. This system of ethics guides the practice of science, from data collection to publication and beyond.\n_The core principle we focus on is just empathy and being able to optimalize for how you train yourself to be more empathetic _<\nThe BCI Developer\nAs a Brain Computer Interface developer, Shifra was exposed with the topic before entering TKS. By reading papers about Neuralink and what Elon Musk was up to, she became fascinated by it,\nIt's such a big paradigm shift from our perception of humanity. Human Intelligence remains very stagnant and to me the technology was super fascinating<\nA Guide to BCI\nA brain-computer interface (BCI) is a computer-based system that acquires brain signals, analyzes them, and translates them into commands that are relayed to an output device to carry out a desired action.\nBrain computer interfaces can be classified in three into three main groups:\nInvasive, partially Invasive and Non-Invasive\n_I've only been exposed to non-invasive BCI because partially invasive and fully invasive BCI A) they are super expensive and B)  there's a lot of regulations surrounding them. And also we just don't know how they work _<\nDiscomfort Challenge\nThink of the mind as a muscle that naturally tightens up over time unless it is consciously worked upon. Your personal growth significanlty depends on new challenges and activities. Tackle the fear that has kept you from living your best life. Your mind has a way of rising to the occasion. Challenge it, and it will reward you.\nChallenge your mind — even making it a little uncomfortable by pushing yourself to learn tasks that may not come naturally. Most things seems impossible until they are done. Give yourself permission to think and act beyong the usual.\nIn TKS, we do a lot of consulting challenges, just to build your understanding of the world<\nSo you know how to navigate (challenges in the real world) them later on<\nBOOKS\nNexus (The Nexus Trilogy Book 1)  (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nexus-Trilogy-Book-1-ebook/dp/B00TOZI7FM/ref=sr_1_1?crid=32OIN6EXVUL7X&keywords=nexus+trilogy&qid=1580117350&s=digital-text&sprefix=nexus+%2Cdigital-text%2C396&sr=1-1)\nWhy Buddhism is True: The Science and Philosophy of Meditation and Enlightenment (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-Buddhism-True-Philosophy-Enlightenment-ebook/dp/B01M5IJLOU/ref=sr_1_1?crid=UGYN3VVHI5ZP&keywords=why+buddhism+is+true&qid=1580094835&s=digital-text&sprefix=why+bu%2Caudible%2C338&sr=1-1)\nNudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth and Happiness (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness-ebook/dp/B009KERBQI/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=nudge&qid=1580094986&s=digital-text&sr=1-1)\nSubscribe!\nIf you enjoyed the podcast please subscribe and rate it.

And I recognized that scientists, in the long run, make the most difference.”\nHaving chosen programming at the age of 15 and for the purpose of making more of a difference to the world, Aubrey continued in that career till he got exposed to something much more demanding.\n\"I started programming, and I thought that one of the biggest problems the world faces is that people have to spend so much of their time doing stuff that they wouldn’t do unless they were being paid for it – I’ll stop that by helping in artificial intelligence research to create more automation. ”\nLearn why Aubrey chose to switch fields back in 1990 and pursue a career that could ultimately fulfil his desire of being able to make as big of a difference to the world as possible. \n\"Having found out that nobody was working on trying to keep people healthy late in life – not properly, anyway – I thought, what? I better switch fields, really? And that’s what led to my moving into the biology of aging back in the early 1990s. ”\nhttps://images.unsplash.com/photo-1566669437687-7040a6926753?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=667&q=80\nRaising Awareness and Concern about the Process of Aging\nOur guest is the person who played a key role in the introduction and spreading of this revolutionary idea in the field of gerontology – a switch from making efforts for the prevention of ‘aging’ to making efforts for the remediation of the process called ‘aging.’\n\"I was fortunate enough to have a few ideas in the late 90s that were quite well received, so I rose to great prominence in gerontology very quickly. In the year 2000, I had the idea that comprehensive damage repair is the most promising and practical way to keep people healthy late in life. ”\n\"My goal is and has always been to grow this movement to a point that I become unnecessary, that there are people in the field who are better than me. And then I will retreat into glorious obscurity. ”\nhttps://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519171920866-a020bf47357b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=750&q=80\nA New Concept in Gerontology\nIt took him much and more to make people realize that not only do they want to live, but they also want to live long and live healthy – that eventually leads to the idea that they want to defeat the biologically deteriorative process called aging.\n\"If it’s all about simple health care and if one recognizes that longevity is simply a side effect of not getting sick, then the argument becomes a great deal easier to make. ”\nLearn why defeating aging is more about reducing the combined effect of time on biological systems than trying to prevent that effect from occurring at all. \n\"The most common sense and most practical approach to keeping people healthy late in life was simply to repair the damage that the body does to itself throughout life, not necessarily perfectly, but well enough so that the overall amount of damage that remains in the body is within the capacity of the body to tolerate. ”\nhttps://images.unsplash.com/photo-1505682614136-0a12f9f7beea?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=751&q=80\nStriving for the Cause\nAubrey has contributed much and more to the spreading of awareness about all these concepts because that is how the scientists can motivate people from all domains to donate and contribute to the progress of research that eventually benefits the whole of mankind. \n\"If you’re working on something that is interesting and important, it’s not such a problem to get people to come and work for you.”\nhttps://images.unsplash.com/photo-1522211988038-6fcbb8c12c7e?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=750&q=80\nHaving an Understanding in Multiple Fields\nLearn how switching fields is one of the most innovative and productive things that can happen in one’s career. It opened a whole new dimension for Aubrey, and it also allows for a profitable transfer of skill sets from one domain to another. \n\"It’s quite clear that when people switch fields, they very often do really good things in the new field because they’ve got the skill set to work on really hard problems because of their transferable skill, but they’re not encumbered by the conventional wisdom that everybody else in the field have.”\nhttps://images.unsplash.com/photo-1546188994-07c34f6e5e1b?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=751&q=80\nHope for the Future\nAubrey has high hopes for the future of gerontology and welcomes any feedback or help that people have to offer him on his way to the achievement of these universal goals. \n\"I think within the next 10 years, we will have reached the threshold of research that I historically have called robust master rejuvenation. It’s only a matter of time before we can bring aging under comprehensive medical control.”\nHe also believes that only a collective effort can uproot the problem altogether.  \n\"I believe that at the end of the day, this problem of aging will not be solved by one person or one organization. It will be a collective effort because it should divide and conquer approach.”\nhttps://images.unsplash.com/photo-1478796415026-3c85ee65975e?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=750&q=80\nMoving Forward\nAubrey is trying to get people to move past all the obstacles that are stopping them from being concerned about aging. Any contribution to the movement that he has initiated is much appreciated. \n\"It’s all about past people’s fear of getting their hopes up and knowing that people have been wrong about the defeat of aging right through the history of civilization.”\nSubscribe!\nIf you enjoyed the podcast please subscribe and rate it.

She is the founder of a personal growth and coaching company called the Litt Factor, and Worthy Human, an inspirational and empowering book.\nTracy's Work\nTracy helps to remind people of their potential, teach the power of their mind, and support them in nurturing an amazing relationship with one’s self.\n\"One of the things that inspires me to teach and coach people, because you can either be a victim or a warrior no matter what external circumstances coming your way. And you can live your life based on what happens outside of you and be a total powerless entity to what that is.\"\nWhere Beliefs Form\nTracy has much motivation and valuable insights based on her life experiences to share with her audience. Learn how – as kids – we develop certain beliefs that we hold throughout our lives. \n\"Anything that’s ever happened to you that has influenced your ability to fully own your inherent worth is a lie. It’s not true. It doesn’t influence it that way. But when we’re kids, we don’t know that we hold our belief systems and then we end up as adults with a 7-year-old controlling our lives, basically thinking that we’re not enough.\"\nRapid Transformation Therapy\nOur guest also talks about how she coaches her clients and other people who are in need of a coach with the help of Energy Assessment and Rapid Transformational Therapy. How we show up in life and experience it is determined by our thoughts, beliefs, feelings, and behaviors.\n\"Ultimately, I’m here to impact people. I am a vessel of healing and growth and inspiration. And I also just do what feels good to me. And I think that’s probably the biggest part of who I am. There’s always someone out there in the world who is waiting for you to show up and share what you know and teach.\"\nChoices\nTracy indicates that the most important thing you have is your power to choose what you believe and think. Everything in your life comes out of you, therefore doing the work of you is non-negotiable if you want to reach your potential and make your dreams a reality.\n\"You get to choose. Everything is based on your power of choice. There is not one thing going on in your life, business, relationships, that isn’t based on your ability to choose. You have a choice; you either take the lesson or keep the pain.\"\nEnergy Healing\nTracy enlightened us that some energy has a catabolic effect on us, which means that our energy levels drop and limit our sense of options. Other energies have an anabolic effect in which our energy levels are elevated and lead us to a state of freedom, choice, power, and fulfillment.

She is the founder of a personal growth and coaching company called the Litt Factor, and Worthy Human, an inspirational and empowering book.</p>\n\n<h4>Tracy&#39;s Work</h4>\n\n<p>Tracy helps to remind people of their potential, teach the power of their mind, and support them in nurturing an amazing relationship with one’s self.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;One of the things that inspires me to teach and coach people, because you can either be a victim or a warrior no matter what external circumstances coming your way. And you can live your life based on what happens outside of you and be a total powerless entity to what that is.&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Where Beliefs Form</h4>\n\n<p>Tracy has much motivation and valuable insights based on her life experiences to share with her audience. Learn how – as kids – we develop certain beliefs that we hold throughout our lives. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;Anything that’s ever happened to you that has influenced your ability to fully own your inherent worth is a lie. It’s not true. It doesn’t influence it that way. But when we’re kids, we don’t know that we hold our belief systems and then we end up as adults with a 7-year-old controlling our lives, basically thinking that we’re not enough.&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Rapid Transformation Therapy</h4>\n\n<p>Our guest also talks about how she coaches her clients and other people who are in need of a coach with the help of Energy Assessment and Rapid Transformational Therapy. How we show up in life and experience it is determined by our thoughts, beliefs, feelings, and behaviors.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;Ultimately, I’m here to impact people. I am a vessel of healing and growth and inspiration. And I also just do what feels good to me. And I think that’s probably the biggest part of who I am. There’s always someone out there in the world who is waiting for you to show up and share what you know and teach.&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Choices</h4>\n\n<p>Tracy indicates that the most important thing you have is your power to choose what you believe and think. Everything in your life comes out of you, therefore doing the work of you is non-negotiable if you want to reach your potential and make your dreams a reality.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;You get to choose. Everything is based on your power of choice. There is not one thing going on in your life, business, relationships, that isn’t based on your ability to choose. You have a choice; you either take the lesson or keep the pain.&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Energy Healing</h4>\n\n<p>Tracy enlightened us that some energy has a catabolic effect on us, which means that our energy levels drop and limit our sense of options. Other energies have an anabolic effect in which our energy levels are elevated and lead us to a state of freedom, choice, power, and fulfillment. Each thought we entertain has an energetic consequence. Over time, catabolic energy injures us while anabolic energy heals or builds us up.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;Catabolic energy is you’re a low-level kind of destructive energy and anabolic energy is growth-oriented, productive when higher energy on the energetic scale. It was another tool for me to help a client with self-discovery and understanding where they are energetically and then through the course of shifting certain behaviours.&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h4>Acceptance</h4>\n\n<p>It is important to allow yourself to simply feel and be yourself – we must accept our human emotions and responses with open arms without being influenced badly by them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>&quot;Getting comfortable feeling all your feelings is a paramount component of living your best life.&quot;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Subscribe!</h2>\n\n<p>If you enjoyed the podcast please <strong><em>subscribe</em></strong> and <strong><em>rate it</em></strong>.

We all want things that don’t make much sense when viewed from a broader perspective. \nThe only way to create something magical is to start with something impossible. *\nNoam shares his radical and influential views about environmental change and other issues that need people’s attention or interest – how their points of view can be manipulated to make them directly link carbon emissions or other harmful substances to the damage they cause and try to be less negligent about such things. \nDo I need to be constantly producing and always getting better every single second of my hour? Probably no. I could be hanging out and just having a nice time with the people here on the course and observing.\nOur guest discusses how school teaches us the black and white reality, but it does not teach us how to deal with it. Whether we should maximize our time and stay productive and busy all the time or we should do nothing at all for at least some fixed time periods. Why, sometimes, finishing things that we start or sticking to them is not as important as we think it is? How gender roles are not fixed and how different errors can also make a business unique and successful. \n*I think that the state of gender is definitely changing a lot. I think that the world is going through a new openness. I think that we’re going through a crisis of masculinity and I think we’re going to see a lot of changes around that. I think that the gender question is definitely going to be a big topic. *\nNoam has an open, innovative, radical, and revolutionary approach to the topics of gender identity, diversity, roles, expression, sexuality, and much more. He believes that the focus is soon going to shift from the stronger or more masculine side of women to the softer or more feminine side of men.\n*I love the feeling that as much as the last hundred years have been about empowering women and about elevating women. I’ve got a feeling that this next phase now and the next five years might be the beginning of reconnecting men with both masculinity and femininity. I can see the response to what I’m doing is so surprising. I mean, for metrosexual men and women in Costa Rica, in the US and the Philippines, young and old, it’s really amazing to see how people are responding. *\nNoam discusses how being on a privileged side of the society in any way makes you unable to complain or be unhappy about anything – especially as a kid – when you keep getting told that there are people who are in a much worse condition. As a young guy, when you are frustrated, you are not allowed to cry because that is sissy, but you are not allowed to shout either. That creates bottled up emotions.\nA moment that something becomes a routine. It’s time for me to change.\nSubscribe!\nIf you enjoyed the podcast please subscribe and rate it.

In this episode we learn how he turned his crazy cooking and story telling ideas into such a success by questioning all normal principles people have for fine dining.

It's very wise to not lose your s#!t when bad things happen. Staying positive is a useful skill to build so that your problems don't multiply (and people don't get bored with your whining)\nTraditionally people often receive deep inspiration and insight from near-death experiences. By all accounts, they come away more intelligent and focused with a renewed energy for life and all its beautiful joys. Curious to find out more Sam conveniently had a terrible accident in October and is currently in recovery with humble aspirations of walking again.\nSam attempts to relive his epic failure and provide take-home lessons in the hope of sounding intelligent and bottling some of this near-death wisdom for listeners. Aspirationally, after listening to this you won't need to risk your life in a quest for profound insights about the fabric of your existence. He also explains how he managed to remain suspiciously happy through the ordeal and the mindsets and terrible jokes he told himself to keep smiling.\nWhether has transcended his problems or simply lost the plot is up to you to decide.

We constantly feel a need to distract it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/B7jjPoZ\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/B7jjPoZ.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>There have been huge movements towards meditation and things like the 5 minute journal that make us think about our lives and appreciate what we should be grateful for. But this still requires a framework to tell our brain it’s doing something rather than letting it just do things by itself.</p>\n\n<p>Sam explains how this creeps into our lives and how to find moments for yourself for ideas and solving your own problems.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>ABOUT THE HOST</h3>\n\n<p>My name is Sam Harris.

But actually if you can zoom out of your momentary pains and look at the bigger picture it probably isn’t that bad. And it might actually be the best thing that could happen to you in the long term. So instead of getting depressed you should get excited to the unknown doors that a failure opens up. The worst thing you can do is let it defeat you \nHave a process\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/z5KIUay\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/z5KIUay.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nIt’s nice to be relaxed and let people be creative, but when you are growing a business this leads to and actually stifles peoples ability to innovate when there is no process to make their ideas happen or work properly with others. Every new thing that comes up make a process for it. It doesn’t have to be the right process straight away, Use feedback to optimise, but put something in place straight away or deal with the consequences. \nSpend time with your users\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/FVtj9NB\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FVtj9NB.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nIf Graze hadn’t worked closely with their customers in the early days they wouldn’t have noticed the opportunity for the referral scheme that exploded their brand across the UK. Who knows where they’d be today if they hadn’t noticed this opportunity. spend time with your customers and get to know them. Observe their first interactions with your brand and products and make the moment special. \nSHOW NOTES\n2:00 - Life story in 4 mins\nGrew up as a geek in a family of medics. His Grandad was a big factor in bringing out geek side\nStudied Engineering maths at Bristol Uni\nMet other graze founders whilst he was building websites\nBuilt Graze for 10 years. crazy ride and finally left 2 years ago\nDid a fair amount of consulting in e-commerce\nMet Bret doing Tiney.co. really into education so joined that biz\n7:45 - Engineering Maths\nBristol Eng Maths was the first year of the course and only 4 students. Very technical degree with a lot of skills learnt.\nComputational Genomics, Machine Learning. Lots of cool stuff.\nGraze\n10:00 - How did you decide Founder Shares\nGraham the founder saw health a big thing that people needed help with. Set up the company and established us as founders so we didn’t need to debate shares too much.\n12:00 - Other Founder Skills\nThey had 3 techies to build things. one on front end. one on billing and one in the factory systems\nAlso Tom his flatmate did the branding work.\nThe team was a unique combination of excellent people who were all great at their thing. They didn’t always agree completely but respected each other and didn’t get caught up in any disagreements..\nGraham had the ultimate control whilst\n15:20 - Research and Funding\nThey tested sending items in post and just went for it.\nRaised £1.1 m . 55 angels giving 10-20k and a VC giving £150k.\nHad a few big failures\n16:20 - Problems Encountered\nLehman brothers and Bank collapse meant they had to bring the price down to keep sales. ended up being useful in the long run and making a product that was more mass market\nThey were delivering fresh fruit and had innovated amazing chopping systems to preserve fruit a bit longer. A big part of their work was investing in getting high quality fruit and being able to deliver it. But with the royal mail strike the fruit was still going off so they had to stop it. \n21:00 - Coming to terms with being a Snack Company\n25:00  - Screening for technical people\nSkills required\nWhen hiring new talent for tech team the technical skills were not the most important as they can be learnt. The most important thing was communication. You can’t learn or be useful if you don’t communicate.\n27:00 - Issues Building Tech\nThey didn’t make the best decisions or prepare for scale properly. They ended up with a giant monolith architecture, it ended up making on-boarding of new hires really slow and a big investment for them. and updating and maintaining a slow headache. Had to rewrite eventually and make it much more slicker and optimised, should have done this earlier in hindsight.\n29:30 - Managing Issues and Processes\nTreat it as an engineering problem. Everything needs to have a process. when you have a good process for reviewing what you are doing and document it and make a good process it all becomes much better. They used to like letting people have free rein but actually really stupid. You can still be creative within set rules.\nWhen people don’t follow the process it is a sign that something is wrong with the process and it needs to be improved\n32:00 - Graze taking off\nThey had a lot of early customers receive a box at work. this was before amazon was big and when post was not really used for stuff. It was like a present arriving and the office would be interested.\nThey were attentive to the experience of early users and saw this happening and realised the opportunity for a referral scheme. then the business exploded across the UK and within a few months suddenly most people had heard of it.\n33:00 - Referral Schemes Thoughts\nStudents took at advantage and they lost money there. Otherwise, it was much cheaper to pay the small price of sending a box to a new customer vs. paying for advertising which is much higher per lead and doesn’t give such a good experience.\n35:20 - Scaling Challenges\nThey were able to quickly keep up with the demand and never missed a delivery (until Edd’s final week) as the did really focus on engineering for scale.\nKept growing the biz over several years and expanded massively into their own factory etc.. eventually left as ten years felt like enough time to dedicate to one thing and ready for a break.\n37:20 - What Edd did after leaving?\nInitially just did nothing for a few months and decompressed.\nThen took up consulting tech for a few days a week.

But actually if you can zoom out of your momentary pains and look at the bigger picture it probably isn’t that bad. And it might actually be the best thing that could happen to you in the long term. So instead of getting depressed you should get excited to the unknown doors that a failure opens up. The worst thing you can do is let it defeat you </p>\n\n<h4>Have a process</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/z5KIUay\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/z5KIUay.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>It’s nice to be relaxed and let people be creative, but when you are growing a business this leads to and actually stifles peoples ability to innovate when there is no process to make their ideas happen or work properly with others. Every new thing that comes up make a process for it. It doesn’t have to be the right process straight away, Use feedback to optimise, but put something in place straight away or deal with the consequences. </p>\n\n<h4>Spend time with your users</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/FVtj9NB\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FVtj9NB.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>If Graze hadn’t worked closely with their customers in the early days they wouldn’t have noticed the opportunity for the referral scheme that exploded their brand across the UK. Who knows where they’d be today if they hadn’t noticed this opportunity. spend time with your customers and get to know them. Observe their first interactions with your brand and products and make the moment special. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>SHOW NOTES</h3>\n\n<p><strong>2:00</strong> - Life story in 4 mins</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Grew up as a geek in a family of medics. His Grandad was a big factor in bringing out geek side</li>\n<li>Studied Engineering maths at Bristol Uni</li>\n<li>Met other graze founders whilst he was building websites</li>\n<li>Built Graze for 10 years. crazy ride and finally left 2 years ago</li>\n<li>Did a fair amount of consulting in e-commerce</li>\n<li>Met Bret doing Tiney.co. really into education so joined that biz</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>7:45</strong> - Engineering Maths</p>\n\n<p>Bristol Eng Maths was the first year of the course and only 4 students. Very technical degree with a lot of skills learnt.</p>\n\n<p>Computational Genomics, Machine Learning. Lots of cool stuff.</p>\n\n<p>Graze</p>\n\n<p><strong>10:00</strong> - How did you decide Founder Shares</p>\n\n<p>Graham the founder saw health a big thing that people needed help with. Set up the company and established us as founders so we didn’t need to debate shares too much.</p>\n\n<p><strong>12:00</strong> - Other Founder Skills</p>\n\n<p>They had 3 techies to build things. one on front end. one on billing and one in the factory systems</p>\n\n<p>Also Tom his flatmate did the branding work.</p>\n\n<p>The team was a unique combination of excellent people who were all great at their thing. They didn’t always agree completely but respected each other and didn’t get caught up in any disagreements..</p>\n\n<p>Graham had the ultimate control whilst</p>\n\n<p><strong>15:20</strong> - Research and Funding</p>\n\n<p>They tested sending items in post and just went for it.</p>\n\n<p>Raised £1.1 m . 55 angels giving 10-20k and a VC giving £150k.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Had a few big failures</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>16:20</strong> - Problems Encountered</p>\n\n<p>Lehman brothers and Bank collapse meant they had to bring the price down to keep sales. ended up being useful in the long run and making a product that was more mass market</p>\n\n<p>They were delivering fresh fruit and had innovated amazing chopping systems to preserve fruit a bit longer. A big part of their work was investing in getting high quality fruit and being able to deliver it. But with the royal mail strike the fruit was still going off so they had to stop it. </p>\n\n<p><strong>21:00</strong> - Coming to terms with being a Snack Company</p>\n\n<p><strong>25:00</strong>  - Screening for technical people</p>\n\n<p>Skills required</p>\n\n<p>When hiring new talent for tech team the technical skills were not the most important as they can be learnt. The most important thing was communication. You can’t learn or be useful if you don’t communicate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>27:00</strong> - Issues Building Tech</p>\n\n<p>They didn’t make the best decisions or prepare for scale properly. They ended up with a giant monolith architecture, it ended up making on-boarding of new hires really slow and a big investment for them. and updating and maintaining a slow headache. Had to rewrite eventually and make it much more slicker and optimised, should have done this earlier in hindsight.</p>\n\n<p><strong>29:30</strong> - Managing Issues and Processes</p>\n\n<p>Treat it as an engineering problem. Everything needs to have a process. when you have a good process for reviewing what you are doing and document it and make a good process it all becomes much better. They used to like letting people have free rein but actually really stupid. You can still be creative within set rules.</p>\n\n<p>When people don’t follow the process it is a sign that something is wrong with the process and it needs to be improved</p>\n\n<p><strong>32:00</strong> - Graze taking off</p>\n\n<p>They had a lot of early customers receive a box at work. this was before amazon was big and when post was not really used for stuff. It was like a present arriving and the office would be interested.</p>\n\n<p>They were attentive to the experience of early users and saw this happening and realised the opportunity for a referral scheme. then the business exploded across the UK and within a few months suddenly most people had heard of it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>33:00</strong> - Referral Schemes Thoughts</p>\n\n<p>Students took at advantage and they lost money there. Otherwise, it was much cheaper to pay the small price of sending a box to a new customer vs. paying for advertising which is much higher per lead and doesn’t give such a good experience.</p>\n\n<p><strong>35:20</strong> - Scaling Challenges</p>\n\n<p>They were able to quickly keep up with the demand and never missed a delivery (until Edd’s final week) as the did really focus on engineering for scale.</p>\n\n<p>Kept growing the biz over several years and expanded massively into their own factory etc.. eventually left as ten years felt like enough time to dedicate to one thing and ready for a break.</p>\n\n<p><strong>37:20</strong> - What Edd did after leaving?</p>\n\n<p>Initially just did nothing for a few months and decompressed.</p>\n\n<p>Then took up consulting tech for a few days a week. Moved more into e-commerce 3 days a week but got a bit bored of it. Needed to do something due to having a mortgage etc.. but not that interested in it all.</p>\n\n<p><strong>38:30</strong> - Consulting Woes</p>\n\n<p>Didn’t enjoy just trying to influence decisions and being a politician and preferred getting hands dirty and doing things.</p>\n\n<p>Put him off CTO jobs and pushed towards creating projects.</p>\n\n<p><strong>40:00</strong> - Consulting Joys</p>\n\n<p>Seeing some different views of the world and knowing what else is out there.</p>\n\n<p>Good money. But risky to get locked into the high pay requirements</p>\n\n<p><strong>42:20</strong> - Important Lessons on Career Change</p>\n\n<p>Really important to decompress and not dive into the next thing.</p>\n\n<p>Tried to keep things low stress and did more cycling.</p>\n\n<p>Work out whats important to you and things like commuting can really effect you and should be factored into things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>45:30</strong> - Joining Tiney.co</p>\n\n<p>Joined Tiney. Bret was founder of Teach First and a lot of experience in the education space. Edd really liked the proposition of Tiney and making professional childcare more accessible and transparent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>48:00</strong> - Innovating in Childcare</p>\n\n<p>Great Team and mission.

It is simply about finding happiness and success for yourself regardless.\nThe worst thing you can do is punish yourself as an act of defiance and to hopefully make someone else’s life worse. Look at the bigger picture and don’t caught up in the moment and just seek to improve yourself.\nYOU CAN TURN ANYTHING AROUND\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/40oY377\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/40oY377.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nWith everything in life going against her Petra was able to completely turn her life around by following her interests. She got through one of the worst periods in her life by making one commitment and sticking with it and then adding more things and it turned into the blossoming career she has today.\nEven your darkest moments can be the inspiration to create a life you love\nUSE SPEAKING AGENTS\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/A2bAqTe\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/A2bAqTe.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nWant to grow your personal brand and do more public speaking.

Managers need more empowerment to talk openly and honestly about mental health\n5:30 -  Bigger companies have more issues\nOld school companies have more issues due to things being in place for a long time. But as new companies are innovating on best practices older companies are starting to catch up.\n7:10 - How did you get into this position\nWell my success came from 12 years of working super hard in the area.\nBut I started from a weird place of being raised in a religious cult and then suffering from alcohol addiction and abuse. After nearly dying I developed a bit more of a nothing matter attitude so I’m very quick to jump right to the heart of the problem and don’t BS around the topic. I’m happy to confront a CEO with their biggest problem and tell them they’re doing things wrong.\nI am just facinated in the area and it kind of happened with me following my curiousity and one thing leading to another.\n9:00 - Have you always been fascinated in mental health problems or did it spark from solving your own problems first?\nIronically I was in some of the darkest moments of my own life whilst studying to be a psychotherapist. There was definitely a deep drive to fix my own problems and survive and became addicted to learning.\n10:00 - So how did you learn the profession exactly?\nInitially I did a one day a week class whilst I was still an alcoholic and I managed to just about keep it up despite feeling awful the entire day.\nI then took on a masters degree at night whilst I was working full time and raising my kids. So anyone who puts something off because they don’t have time is lying to themselves.\nI was really lucky to even get on the course, when I started I didn’t have a plan for how to pay for it but I just took the leap and worked it out as I went along\n11:20 - How did you deal with addiction and getting out of it?\nI went to Alcoholics anonymous which definitely saved me and it was essential for the first two years. But it is also really cult-like and I am hyper sensitive to cults after being raised in one so I was happy to leave once I was strong enough. I don’t want to give up my power and control in the long term. In the short term it was great to have people around to talk to and release my problems. It was great to admit I just really needed a drink right now, but once it was out there it suddenly felt easier to deal with.\nAfter I was stronger I found AA limiting being around others who were complaining about their problems and needing to drink etc… and was actually unhealthy for me. So I tried to build a network of people that lift me up.\n13:45 - Sounds like a very mindful process to realise the moments when you need a drink and intervene\nYes I really needed that ability to call someone when I had an urge. I also really relied on a 3 minute meditation after every urge to stop and think mindfully about why I shouldn’t do it. I must have listened a million times. Any time I had a slight level of cortisol increase I would need it.\n15:05 - So what does being raised in a cult mean?\nit sounds black and white but it was all shades of grey. Lots of hippie communes and travelling to events and classes. It has a lot of similarities to organisations as they grow, it takes one toxic person to suddenly change the entire atmosphere.\nThere is a weird brainwashing feedback loop where If you agree with the group you get rewarded and promoted and more privileges. If you try to change the trend at all you are ostracised and told your a bad person. Because you have no money and rely on the group and have nowhere to go you. This reinforces the idea that they are right and if you leave god will punish you.\nFor all my generation in the cult we had major trauma around being unable to build a life outside the cult or knowing what to do\n18:00 - Did you keep in touch with other members then?\nIt took a few years to be completely isolated from that way of thinking to build my opinions. I really needed a growth mindset to become a different person first to then talk with them all about the experience and how bad it was without feeling like I still needed it. Take responsibility for myself first\n19:00 - Taking responsibility is always a good step to get out of the victim mindset\nI’ve really started to focus on this and so many people that go through worse stuff and find. There is never a good reason to feel like a victim when you can take ownership. This is the point of my podcast\n20:10 - Breaking through adversity is a really good topic. How did you first select the theme and start the podcast?\nI guess I was listening to a lot of podcasts and always wanted to be a radio host when I was young. I thought about what I really needed to hear when I was in my problems but also can I satisfy my curiosity and learn at the same time. So even if no-one listens I will still enjoy it.\nThen the first few episodes really helped me. Since then I’ve good periods and bad periods and learn what works.\n23:30 - So what were your biggest lessons\nI guess it sometimes felt like just work and occasionally even I would be bored. So now I have a priming conversation to get connected and work out their direction and theme we can focus on for the podcast.\n24:00 - What’s your favourite question to ask people?\nI like knowing what challenges they are facing now and their general practices. people saying it used to be bad and now it’s perfect is just wrong.\n25:45 - So what are your big challenges currently?\nI’m taking on a lot of public speaking which is quite scary and difficult but it’s really helping me grow and it’s a challenge I like to have.\nI also have two teenagers which I share with my ex-husband half the week. coming to terms with his new wife is not easy.\nI’m defining my no BS approach to mental health and building a course for it which is also a challenge I’m taking on.\n27:30 - How about writing a book\nI spoke to a publisher and really want to do this also. So I will definitely try and do this.\n27:50 - How did you start a public speaking career\nI hustled a lot. I worked helping kids where I wasn’t needed but I kept on showing up. I took every opportunity to speak at meet ups and and consistently showing up. I made tonnes of mistakes and had things go wrong but I just keep going and it gets better. The world doesn’t end when i mess up on stage and I just carry on. \nThen I’m really good at finding mentors. If you find people who have done it and ask for help then you can really open up a lot of opportunities. Do what they tell you to do and then they’ll help you more.\n30:30 - So did you stick with just one agency\nDefinitely register on as many as possible. They all have different connections and have different things that work better or worse for your type of content.\nAnd go to the agency and show up and show them why your type of content is important and how it can be funny. When they know your personality they know how to sell you.\n31:00 - Most important tip\nOne rejection does not mean you are not on the right path, it just means you might not be right for that person or it happens to be the wrong time of the day etc.. Keep on trying and showing up!\nSo many people give up, if you believe just do it anyway\n31:30 - What do you see in the future of mental health?\nThere will be a framework that companies need to align with to prove they are doing all the right things to ensure good mental health.\nCompanies will be competitive to provide the best mental health.\nYoung people want to work for companies of purpose and have great satisfaction and wellbeing in what they do\n33:30 - what do you do now for you mental health\nI’m trying the 5am club. the victory hour when you start\n20 mins exercise\n20 mins goal setting\n20 mins learning\nit basically means you are brainwashing yourself to be awesome and gives you and hour away from tech.\nthen again in the evening writing your reflections:\n3 things I’m grateful for\n3 things to do that will make today a success\n3 things i want to be today\n35:40 - Whats the best advice you’ve been given\n“The best revenge is living a good life.”\nInstead of focussing on messing up your life or other peoples this flips it into a positive action to just go and be awesome.\nThen it also links to my other favourite quote.\n“It’s all your fault”\nEverything that happens is down to you. You have control to fix it or not. accept responsibility and then you can change it. Anything that happens now that goes wrong I can take on. People who always blame everything around them are going nowhere.\n36:45 - What is the kindest thing someone did for you?\nEx husband really helped me get through my worst problems at the time. He also presented many other problems but his consistent help was the most incredible thing when I needed it. \n37:40 - Most vivid memory from childhood\nOne of my family members getting consistently punished in front of everyone and not having a voice to be able to do anything about it. This really forced me to never not have a voice instead, I have always felt like a coward since for not doing something or saying ‘punish me instead’. This has propelled me into having a voice and empowering others to have a voice.\n38:40 - let’s flip questioning. What scares Sam the most?\nGetting too comfortable with something that is quite successful and 90% there and seeking a new challenge when you haven’t really made the most of mastering the thing you are doing. You can get panicked by getting by being about to have a clear success which you need to commit to and jump to something else.\nExistential life worry around women. Any day it isn’t really a problem that affects me and I”m pretty happy doing my thing. But if I just plod through life and get to 90 without every having a wife to share my life with that seems like one of the most important sources of joy I am completely missing out on.\n41:00 - Time to apply the overnight success philosophy to dating. take the rejections and put in the time.\nyou get better at it. now I’m really good at the first three months but after that I hit issues. But you get better at communicating your problems early and having honest conversations\ntrue. but yes as a guy it does take a lot of work to just get two dates on tinder. I guess more in person things and get used to loads of rejections and try and get 5 girls numbers a day and be used to talking to new woman all the time and make statistics work in your favour.\n41:45 - So what’s the writing Sam is doing and your big goals\nToo many things. Psychology and mindsets, business advice, life advice, meta lessons you can learn from stupid things like 50 shades of grey. And then meditation, there’s a whole book to be written on the crazy journey that happens in your brain during a 10 day Vipassana retreat that’s never really been told. It’s weird but Vipassana was actually really funny and the whole thing felt like a comedy show of your life and how hilariously stupid you are, it could be told in a really nice way.\nI love improving at things and working on my craft.

She has a radical 'no BS' approach to mental health and isn't afraid to come out with some hard hitting facts of life.</p>\n\n<p>She has a challenging personal story from being raised in a cult which she broke out of to then fall into alcohol abuse and motherhood. Her tale of turning herself around to get her qualifications and become a shining beacon of inspiration and advice to others is amazing. She is a true advocate of the Growth Mindset and an absolute legend.</p>\n\n<p>On the show we go through her dark history and the amazing challenges she overcame. But it is not a perfect wonder story and we both reflect on our own current challenges instead of pretending we have arrived at this Nirvana of knowing everything and being happy which too many people pretend. This is a hard hitting episode with lots of insights and tips for really being true to yourself, taking accountability and becoming the person you should be.</p>\n\n<p><br></p>\n\n<h4>Petra</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/68HdikP\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/68HdikP.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/petra-velzeboer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Connect on LinkedIn</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://petravelzeboer.com/podcast\" rel=\"nofollow\">Adversity to Advantage Podcast</a><br>\n<a href=\"http://petravelzeboer.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/PetraVelzeboer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>ABOUT THE HOST</h3>\n\n<p>My name is Sam Harris.

It is simply about finding happiness and success for yourself regardless.</p>\n\n<p>The worst thing you can do is punish yourself as an act of defiance and to hopefully make someone else’s life worse. Look at the bigger picture and don’t caught up in the moment and just seek to improve yourself.</p>\n\n<h4>YOU CAN TURN ANYTHING AROUND</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/40oY377\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/40oY377.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>With everything in life going against her Petra was able to completely turn her life around by following her interests. She got through one of the worst periods in her life by making one commitment and sticking with it and then adding more things and it turned into the blossoming career she has today.</p>\n\n<p>Even your darkest moments can be the inspiration to create a life you love</p>\n\n<h4>USE SPEAKING AGENTS</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/A2bAqTe\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/A2bAqTe.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Want to grow your personal brand and do more public speaking.

Put a face to the name and help them get to know your brand.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>NOTES</h3>\n\n<p><strong>1:30</strong> - MENTAL HEALTH CONSULTANT WHAT IS THAT?<br>\ncoaching CEO’s and VPs so it can be coaching but also relationships.</p>\n\n<p>Mainly go into companies to help their strategy on a mental health perspective</p>\n\n<p><strong>2:40</strong> - Are there any common themes between business</p>\n\n<p>Work with many different business, always humans so fundamentally it is all quite similar</p>\n\n<p><strong>3:35</strong> - what are the common mental health problems in startups?</p>\n\n<p>Systems and structure that is needed as you scale up often fails. Managers need more empowerment to talk openly and honestly about mental health</p>\n\n<p><strong>5:30</strong> -  Bigger companies have more issues</p>\n\n<p>Old school companies have more issues due to things being in place for a long time. But as new companies are innovating on best practices older companies are starting to catch up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7:10</strong> - How did you get into this position</p>\n\n<p>Well my success came from 12 years of working super hard in the area.</p>\n\n<p>But I started from a weird place of being raised in a religious cult and then suffering from alcohol addiction and abuse. After nearly dying I developed a bit more of a nothing matter attitude so I’m very quick to jump right to the heart of the problem and don’t BS around the topic. I’m happy to confront a CEO with their biggest problem and tell them they’re doing things wrong.</p>\n\n<p>I am just facinated in the area and it kind of happened with me following my curiousity and one thing leading to another.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9:00</strong> - Have you always been fascinated in mental health problems or did it spark from solving your own problems first?</p>\n\n<p>Ironically I was in some of the darkest moments of my own life whilst studying to be a psychotherapist. There was definitely a deep drive to fix my own problems and survive and became addicted to learning.</p>\n\n<p><strong>10:00</strong> - So how did you learn the profession exactly?</p>\n\n<p>Initially I did a one day a week class whilst I was still an alcoholic and I managed to just about keep it up despite feeling awful the entire day.</p>\n\n<p>I then took on a masters degree at night whilst I was working full time and raising my kids. So anyone who puts something off because they don’t have time is lying to themselves.</p>\n\n<p>I was really lucky to even get on the course, when I started I didn’t have a plan for how to pay for it but I just took the leap and worked it out as I went along</p>\n\n<p><strong>11:20</strong> - How did you deal with addiction and getting out of it?</p>\n\n<p>I went to Alcoholics anonymous which definitely saved me and it was essential for the first two years. But it is also really cult-like and I am hyper sensitive to cults after being raised in one so I was happy to leave once I was strong enough. I don’t want to give up my power and control in the long term. In the short term it was great to have people around to talk to and release my problems. It was great to admit I just really needed a drink right now, but once it was out there it suddenly felt easier to deal with.</p>\n\n<p>After I was stronger I found AA limiting being around others who were complaining about their problems and needing to drink etc… and was actually unhealthy for me. So I tried to build a network of people that lift me up.</p>\n\n<p><strong>13:45</strong> - Sounds like a very mindful process to realise the moments when you need a drink and intervene</p>\n\n<p>Yes I really needed that ability to call someone when I had an urge. I also really relied on a 3 minute meditation after every urge to stop and think mindfully about why I shouldn’t do it. I must have listened a million times. Any time I had a slight level of cortisol increase I would need it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>15:05</strong> - So what does being raised in a cult mean?</p>\n\n<p>it sounds black and white but it was all shades of grey. Lots of hippie communes and travelling to events and classes. It has a lot of similarities to organisations as they grow, it takes one toxic person to suddenly change the entire atmosphere.</p>\n\n<p>There is a weird brainwashing feedback loop where If you agree with the group you get rewarded and promoted and more privileges. If you try to change the trend at all you are ostracised and told your a bad person. Because you have no money and rely on the group and have nowhere to go you. This reinforces the idea that they are right and if you leave god will punish you.</p>\n\n<p>For all my generation in the cult we had major trauma around being unable to build a life outside the cult or knowing what to do</p>\n\n<p><strong>18:00</strong> - Did you keep in touch with other members then?</p>\n\n<p>It took a few years to be completely isolated from that way of thinking to build my opinions. I really needed a growth mindset to become a different person first to then talk with them all about the experience and how bad it was without feeling like I still needed it. Take responsibility for myself first</p>\n\n<p><strong>19:00</strong> - Taking responsibility is always a good step to get out of the victim mindset</p>\n\n<p>I’ve really started to focus on this and so many people that go through worse stuff and find. There is never a good reason to feel like a victim when you can take ownership. This is the point of my podcast</p>\n\n<p><strong>20:10</strong> - Breaking through adversity is a really good topic. How did you first select the theme and start the podcast?</p>\n\n<p>I guess I was listening to a lot of podcasts and always wanted to be a radio host when I was young. I thought about what I really needed to hear when I was in my problems but also can I satisfy my curiosity and learn at the same time. So even if no-one listens I will still enjoy it.</p>\n\n<p>Then the first few episodes really helped me. Since then I’ve good periods and bad periods and learn what works.</p>\n\n<p><strong>23:30</strong> - So what were your biggest lessons</p>\n\n<p>I guess it sometimes felt like just work and occasionally even I would be bored. So now I have a priming conversation to get connected and work out their direction and theme we can focus on for the podcast.</p>\n\n<p><strong>24:00</strong> - What’s your favourite question to ask people?</p>\n\n<p>I like knowing what challenges they are facing now and their general practices. people saying it used to be bad and now it’s perfect is just wrong.</p>\n\n<p><strong>25:45</strong> - So what are your big challenges currently?</p>\n\n<p>I’m taking on a lot of public speaking which is quite scary and difficult but it’s really helping me grow and it’s a challenge I like to have.</p>\n\n<p>I also have two teenagers which I share with my ex-husband half the week. coming to terms with his new wife is not easy.</p>\n\n<p>I’m defining my no BS approach to mental health and building a course for it which is also a challenge I’m taking on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>27:30</strong> - How about writing a book</p>\n\n<p>I spoke to a publisher and really want to do this also. So I will definitely try and do this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>27:50</strong> - How did you start a public speaking career</p>\n\n<p>I hustled a lot. I worked helping kids where I wasn’t needed but I kept on showing up. I took every opportunity to speak at meet ups and and consistently showing up. I made tonnes of mistakes and had things go wrong but I just keep going and it gets better. The world doesn’t end when i mess up on stage and I just carry on. </p>\n\n<p>Then I’m really good at finding mentors. If you find people who have done it and ask for help then you can really open up a lot of opportunities. Do what they tell you to do and then they’ll help you more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>30:30</strong> - So did you stick with just one agency</p>\n\n<p>Definitely register on as many as possible. They all have different connections and have different things that work better or worse for your type of content.</p>\n\n<p>And go to the agency and show up and show them why your type of content is important and how it can be funny. When they know your personality they know how to sell you.</p>\n\n<p><strong>31:00</strong> - Most important tip</p>\n\n<p>One rejection does not mean you are not on the right path, it just means you might not be right for that person or it happens to be the wrong time of the day etc.. Keep on trying and showing up!</p>\n\n<p>So many people give up, if you believe just do it anyway</p>\n\n<p><strong>31:30</strong> - What do you see in the future of mental health?</p>\n\n<p>There will be a framework that companies need to align with to prove they are doing all the right things to ensure good mental health.</p>\n\n<p>Companies will be competitive to provide the best mental health.</p>\n\n<p>Young people want to work for companies of purpose and have great satisfaction and wellbeing in what they do</p>\n\n<p><strong>33:30</strong> - what do you do now for you mental health</p>\n\n<p>I’m trying the 5am club. the victory hour when you start</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>20 mins exercise</li>\n<li>20 mins goal setting</li>\n<li>20 mins learning</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>it basically means you are brainwashing yourself to be awesome and gives you and hour away from tech.</p>\n\n<p>then again in the evening writing your reflections:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>3 things I’m grateful for</li>\n<li>3 things to do that will make today a success</li>\n<li>3 things i want to be today</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>35:40</strong> - Whats the best advice you’ve been given</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“The best revenge is living a good life.”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Instead of focussing on messing up your life or other peoples this flips it into a positive action to just go and be awesome.</p>\n\n<p>Then it also links to my other favourite quote.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“It’s all your fault”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Everything that happens is down to you. You have control to fix it or not. accept responsibility and then you can change it. Anything that happens now that goes wrong I can take on. People who always blame everything around them are going nowhere.</p>\n\n<p><strong>36:45</strong> - What is the kindest thing someone did for you?</p>\n\n<p>Ex husband really helped me get through my worst problems at the time. He also presented many other problems but his consistent help was the most incredible thing when I needed it. </p>\n\n<p><strong>37:40</strong> - Most vivid memory from childhood</p>\n\n<p>One of my family members getting consistently punished in front of everyone and not having a voice to be able to do anything about it. This really forced me to never not have a voice instead, I have always felt like a coward since for not doing something or saying ‘punish me instead’. This has propelled me into having a voice and empowering others to have a voice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>38:40</strong> - let’s flip questioning. What scares Sam the most?</p>\n\n<p>Getting too comfortable with something that is quite successful and 90% there and seeking a new challenge when you haven’t really made the most of mastering the thing you are doing. You can get panicked by getting by being about to have a clear success which you need to commit to and jump to something else.</p>\n\n<p>Existential life worry around women. Any day it isn’t really a problem that affects me and I”m pretty happy doing my thing. But if I just plod through life and get to 90 without every having a wife to share my life with that seems like one of the most important sources of joy I am completely missing out on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>41:00</strong> - Time to apply the overnight success philosophy to dating. take the rejections and put in the time.</p>\n\n<p>you get better at it. now I’m really good at the first three months but after that I hit issues. But you get better at communicating your problems early and having honest conversations</p>\n\n<p>true. but yes as a guy it does take a lot of work to just get two dates on tinder. I guess more in person things and get used to loads of rejections and try and get 5 girls numbers a day and be used to talking to new woman all the time and make statistics work in your favour.</p>\n\n<p><strong>41:45</strong> - So what’s the writing Sam is doing and your big goals</p>\n\n<p>Too many things. Psychology and mindsets, business advice, life advice, meta lessons you can learn from stupid things like 50 shades of grey. And then meditation, there’s a whole book to be written on the crazy journey that happens in your brain during a 10 day Vipassana retreat that’s never really been told. It’s weird but Vipassana was actually really funny and the whole thing felt like a comedy show of your life and how hilariously stupid you are, it could be told in a really nice way.</p>\n\n<p>I love improving at things and working on my craft. I really hope to be able to reach people and improve their lives as well with my learnings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>44:45</strong> - yea ten days of silent retreat sounds horrible I hate the idea of it. perhaps one day I’ll be brave enough.</p>\n\n<p>It will be worth it!</p>\n\n<h2>Subscribe!</h2>\n\n<p>If you enjoyed the podcast please <strong><em>subscribe</em></strong> and <strong><em>rate it</em></strong>.

Just choose the right things for you that are manageable and get you to achieve your definition of success\n3:40 - What are Kathryn’s goals?\nNot working all the time. Working half days and travelling. freedom and choice to travel and work with who she wants\n4:30 - What are Kathryn’s external goals?\nHelp people see their potential and achieve it.\n5:15 - What does she focus on to achieve her end goals?\nJournaling to keep herself focussed (5 minute journal)\nKeeping in touch with her main message and strategy\n6:45 - How does she sell to her clients?\nDifferent clients but she makes evergreen content people can work through and see if they like her. Blog, podcast, email newsletter, webinars\n8:45 - Why only work with women?\nHer content is relevant to anyone but women like having coaching just for them\n9:30 - Victim vs. Victor mindset?\nBeing female doesn’t make you a victim it is your mindset and creating awareness that you can choose how to respond is key\n11:30 - A time when Kathryn had a big mindset change\n5 years she was working too hard. Decided to start her own business and that success was going to be the only option. Consciously decided to go all in and made it happen on her own terms without giving up\n13:45 - Top Tips in marketing\nPeople see too many tactics and then think that this new tactic will be a magic bullet and put all their hopes into that. It requires 4 main components:\nStrategy\nVisibility\nPromoting\nSales\nPeople use one tactic and then try to sell people straight away. Make a clear process of leading them down a funnel and having a clear action at the end of each piece of content\n17:00 - Biggest mistake in Marketing\nNot knowing their customer. They don’t use the right language or frame the product in the right way.\nPeople want specialists. If you need heart surgery you want a great heart surgeon and not a general doctor\n19:30 - Importance of choosing your clients\nIf you aren’t selective then you’ll get clients you don’t want and create a portfolio and background doing what you don’t want to do. Then you make more sales you don’t want\n21:00 - The Future of Marketing\nContent creation is too easy and everyone is making content. Now it is hard to get peoples attention so you need to be truly unique and special. You need to deserve peoples attention\n23:00 - Importance of balance\nConstantly creating or consuming content can be bad and you need to give yourself and audience a break sometimes to think their own thoughts.\nDon’t create more content that is already out there\n26:00 - Favourite book - Drive by Daniel Pink\nHumans are driven by Purpose, Mastery and Autonomy. Remember this and focus on helping others achieve this\n27:00 - Kindest thing\nShe was given a job with tasks outside her comfort zone and abilities but with a safe space to make mistakes and improve. Developed her confidence and skills amazingly quickly.\n28:30 - Giving people the opportunity to fail\nfailure isn’t exactly a target but it’s great to allow\n29:30 - Most vivid memory from childhood\nAfter parents divorced sitting with her mother who sang to her and was strong for Kathryn even though she was going through her own problems\n31:00 - Kathryns other work\nShe gives back a lot and works with communities and churches to help them do more good\n32:00 - Kathryn asks Sam about the mindset podcast\nA good chance to be nosey and find out how people work and why they make the decisions they make and how success and happiness happens\n33:20 - If you could do anything with unlimited resources and no fear what would you do?\nMake a massive fund to research and solve climate change.\n34:00 - What would Kathryn do with unlimited resources\nHelp everyone realise their full potential and empowering them to do it\nThis is what we are both trying to achieve with our current work and even if we impact a few people that is still a huge result.\nSubscribe!\nIf you enjoyed the podcast please subscribe and rate it.

Creating an open space for people to make mistakes and not feel that they need to hide them means they can develop greatly as an individual.</p>\n\n<h4>DON’T BE A VICTIM OF YOUR SITUATION</h4>\n\n<p>Life happens and there are things you can’t control. but you can always control yourself and improve your situation by taking responsibility and ownership. If you stand by and passively let life happen to be you are destined to always be a victim of your situation. If you take control then you can achieve anything.</p>\n\n<p>“You can’t control everything that is happening in your life. But you can control how you view it;</p>\n\n<p>As happening to you and against you vs. How it is benefitting you, what the opportunity is, how you can learn from it and be grateful for it”</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>ABOUT THE HOST</h3>\n\n<p>My name is Sam Harris.

Just choose the right things for you that are manageable and get you to achieve your definition of success</p>\n\n<p><strong>3:40</strong> - What are Kathryn’s goals?</p>\n\n<p>Not working all the time. Working half days and travelling. freedom and choice to travel and work with who she wants</p>\n\n<p><strong>4:30</strong> - What are Kathryn’s external goals?</p>\n\n<p>Help people see their potential and achieve it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5:15</strong> - What does she focus on to achieve her end goals?</p>\n\n<p>Journaling to keep herself focussed (5 minute journal)</p>\n\n<p>Keeping in touch with her main message and strategy</p>\n\n<p><strong>6:45</strong> - How does she sell to her clients?</p>\n\n<p>Different clients but she makes evergreen content people can work through and see if they like her. Blog, podcast, email newsletter, webinars</p>\n\n<p><strong>8:45</strong> - Why only work with women?</p>\n\n<p>Her content is relevant to anyone but women like having coaching just for them</p>\n\n<p><strong>9:30</strong> - Victim vs. Victor mindset?</p>\n\n<p>Being female doesn’t make you a victim it is your mindset and creating awareness that you can choose how to respond is key</p>\n\n<p><strong>11:30</strong> - A time when Kathryn had a big mindset change</p>\n\n<p>5 years she was working too hard. Decided to start her own business and that success was going to be the only option. Consciously decided to go all in and made it happen on her own terms without giving up</p>\n\n<p><strong>13:45</strong> - Top Tips in marketing</p>\n\n<p>People see too many tactics and then think that this new tactic will be a magic bullet and put all their hopes into that. It requires 4 main components:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Strategy</li>\n<li>Visibility</li>\n<li>Promoting</li>\n<li>Sales</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>People use one tactic and then try to sell people straight away. Make a clear process of leading them down a funnel and having a clear action at the end of each piece of content</p>\n\n<p><strong>17:00</strong> - Biggest mistake in Marketing</p>\n\n<p>Not knowing their customer. They don’t use the right language or frame the product in the right way.</p>\n\n<p>People want specialists. If you need heart surgery you want a great heart surgeon and not a general doctor</p>\n\n<p><strong>19:30</strong> - Importance of choosing your clients</p>\n\n<p>If you aren’t selective then you’ll get clients you don’t want and create a portfolio and background doing what you don’t want to do. Then you make more sales you don’t want</p>\n\n<p><strong>21:00</strong> - The Future of Marketing</p>\n\n<p>Content creation is too easy and everyone is making content. Now it is hard to get peoples attention so you need to be truly unique and special. You need to deserve peoples attention</p>\n\n<p><strong>23:00</strong> - Importance of balance</p>\n\n<p>Constantly creating or consuming content can be bad and you need to give yourself and audience a break sometimes to think their own thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t create more content that is already out there</p>\n\n<p><strong>26:00</strong> - Favourite book - Drive by Daniel Pink</p>\n\n<p>Humans are driven by Purpose, Mastery and Autonomy. Remember this and focus on helping others achieve this</p>\n\n<p><strong>27:00</strong> - Kindest thing</p>\n\n<p>She was given a job with tasks outside her comfort zone and abilities but with a safe space to make mistakes and improve. Developed her confidence and skills amazingly quickly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>28:30</strong> - Giving people the opportunity to fail</p>\n\n<p>failure isn’t exactly a target but it’s great to allow</p>\n\n<p><strong>29:30</strong> - Most vivid memory from childhood</p>\n\n<p>After parents divorced sitting with her mother who sang to her and was strong for Kathryn even though she was going through her own problems</p>\n\n<p><strong>31:00</strong> - Kathryns other work</p>\n\n<p>She gives back a lot and works with communities and churches to help them do more good</p>\n\n<p><strong>32:00</strong> - Kathryn asks Sam about the mindset podcast</p>\n\n<p>A good chance to be nosey and find out how people work and why they make the decisions they make and how success and happiness happens</p>\n\n<p><strong>33:20</strong> - If you could do anything with unlimited resources and no fear what would you do?</p>\n\n<p>Make a massive fund to research and solve climate change.</p>\n\n<p><strong>34:00</strong> - What would Kathryn do with unlimited resources</p>\n\n<p>Help everyone realise their full potential and empowering them to do it</p>\n\n<p>This is what we are both trying to achieve with our current work and even if we impact a few people that is still a huge result.</p>\n\n<h2>Subscribe!</h2>\n\n<p>If you enjoyed the podcast please <strong><em>subscribe</em></strong> and <strong><em>rate it</em></strong>.

It is really hard to build a brand. To make a campaign that people actually engage with you have to push the boat out and really make people think about what you are telling them and make it something memorable.\nHAVE A PURPOSE\nThings get pretty depressing pretty quickly when you don’t have a purpose. It’s really interesting to see what happens in life when you have basically arrived at all the metrics of success one needs to achieve in one life. What the hell do you then go and do?\nBE NICE\nLooking after those around you and giving back to people that helped you or people that can learn from you is really important and a crucial way to not get too caught up in all your own problems and be grateful for what you do have.\nBONUS - BRAND TRUMPS DATA\nMany marketers obsessively focus on all important metrics to drive success. Of course, success is defined by the metrics you track. However, this can lead to marketing teams ignoring their brand, as it is a hard intangible metric to measure.\nMat makes the point that when you make brand your top metric to work towards then all your other metrics will go up anyway. So you should never ignore your brand!\nBOOKS\nGet any of the books free on audible (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00OPA2XFG?tag=samharris48%E2%80%9321)\nEATING THE BIG FISH BY ADAM MORGAN (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Eating-Big-Fish-Challenger-Compete/dp/B008TT17OM/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=eat+big+fish&qid=1580912250&s=books&sr=1-1)\nThis is all about taking a smaller brand and challenging the big brands in the market and beating them, which is exactly what Just Eat did and thus a perfect book for further reading.\nSAPIENS BY YUVAL NOAH HARARI (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sapiens/dp/B00VXKB596/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=sapiens&qid=1580912228&s=books&sr=1-1)\nA masterpiece on the evolution and history of the entire human species up to today and why the world is how it is and a beautiful insight into human minds.\nSubscribe!\nIf you enjoyed the podcast please subscribe and rate it.

Every time you're speaking that is a time when your guest isn’t. Your podcasts or any form of interviews get much better when you stop trying to control the interview and make it about you and just focus on the person you’re talking to. \nPLAN OUT YOUR IDEA\nWith solid preparation, Dan managed to get 10,000 users in one night. That is insane. Compared to so many ideas I’ve seen with people spending years to get a thousand users. Caught up in running around doing all these different things and not using focussed effort on the most important areas to get the most leverage. \nThis is definitely a great example of the 80/20 rule and focusing on what matters.\nFOCUS ON A NICHE\nDan’s podcast is highly focused on just Great Business Leaders with a crazy amount of experience. He releases 16 episodes a year and in 2 years already had over a million listens, and I'm sure this year it’s going stratospheric. When you focus on just a quality niche it’s much easier to grow what you do and can take a lot less effort.\nIt a sad truth that I am just too interested in too many things to nail myself down to one concept for the podcast and love being available to talk to any fascinating human. But, I’m definitely changing tactics to become a seasonal podcast where I go deep on one niche at a time and really make high-quality content for one field at a time.\nBOOKS\nGet any of the books free on audible (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00OPA2XFG?tag=samharris48%E2%80%9321)\nI know for a fact some of Dan’s favourite books are ‘Lost Connections (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lost-Connections-Uncovering-Depression-Unexpected/dp/B078HH4HF4/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2HXFZGH4Z37MX&keywords=lost+connections+johann+hari&qid=1580906136&s=books&sprefix=lost+co%2Caudible%2C384&sr=1-1)’ by Johann Hari and ‘12 Rules for Life (https://www.amazon.co.uk/12-Rules-Life-Antidote-Chaos/dp/B078YBSPYZ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1ZU7IUT7INDR7&keywords=12+rules+for+life&qid=1580906168&s=books&sprefix=12+rules%2Caudible%2C447&sr=1-1)’ by Jordan Peterson.\nAnother favourite is ‘How To Change Your Mind (https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-to-Change-Your-Mind/dp/B07CT42TNF/ref=sr_1_1?crid=12AGK0N435PJ2&keywords=how+to+change+your+mind&qid=1580906206&s=books&sprefix=how+to+chang%2Caudible%2C382&sr=1-1)’ by Michael Pollan, which we will both discuss in depth on a future podcast you can look forward to in my upcoming Mindset bookclub.\nSubscribe!\nIf you enjoyed the podcast please subscribe and rate it.

Both Nav and I suffer from this and when you learn to say no and be protective of your time to truly deliver at a top level on just a few focused projects things get a whole lot better\nONLY DO IT IF YOU LOVE IT\nTo succeed in the arts you have to just love the art that you are doing, whether it is writing, painting or music. it shouldn’t be about fame or other things because that won’t come instantly and you won’t enjoy yourself. you will constantly be questioned and challenged by what you're doing and if you don’t love it you will give up. I really liked his example that a banker doesn’t have to get tested to see if he can be a banker every week, but as an artist, you are constantly auditioning to even be able to do your job.\nThis leads nicely into another important point about\nHAVE THE RIGHT GOALS AND METRICS OF SUCCESS\nWhen the choir were in a big competition and put in loads of work and hours they had an awesome experience and massively grew the profile of the choir, every person involved gained new skills and they made beautiful music. yet because they didn’t win the competition they felt like failures. if you removed the bit where you mention your in a competition and just say that your going to be in TV to millions of people and be awesome that sounds great and hardly something to get depressed about. So before you do anything it is important to remind yourself what is the real value from what you are doing and what you want to get out of it before you chase the wrong goals.\nBONUS TIP - NOMINATE SOMEONE FOR AN AWARD\nBeing nominated for a BCA was one of the best things that happened to him and also thoroughly deserving. Similarly, with a previous guest Lisa Forte who was nominated for top 100 women in Tech it's great when someone who really deserves recognition gets it. So I’m pretty sure we all must know someone in our community that deserves more recognition. So just nominate them. Whether it's for a BCA or Top person in Tech or any other award. If someone has been making your day brighter give back and give them a nomination. If they are doing great work already they’ll be able to do twice as much if you give them a little bit of help.\nWhen developing gratitude they say you should write more letters to people deserving, but going one step further and getting them a nice award is five times better and I”m sure you will feel fantastic if your favourite local hero gets an award because of you. It really is the least you can do\nBOOKS\nGet any of the books free on audible (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00OPA2XFG?tag=samharris48%E2%80%9321)\nDUNE - FRANK HERBERT (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dune/dp/B002SQ5UD6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=41KUIV91K19S&keywords=dune+frank+herbert&qid=1580904998&s=books&sprefix=dune%2Caudible%2C402&sr=1-1)\nSet in the far future amidst a sprawling feudal interstellar empire where planetary dynasties are controlled by noble houses.

If someone has been making your day brighter give back and give them a nomination. If they are doing great work already they’ll be able to do twice as much if you give them a little bit of help.</p>\n\n<p>When developing gratitude they say you should write more letters to people deserving, but going one step further and getting them a nice award is five times better and I”m sure you will feel fantastic if your favourite local hero gets an award because of you. It really is the least you can do</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>BOOKS</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00OPA2XFG?tag=samharris48%E2%80%9321\" rel=\"nofollow\">Get any of the books free on audible</a></p>\n\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dune/dp/B002SQ5UD6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=41KUIV91K19S&keywords=dune+frank+herbert&qid=1580904998&s=books&sprefix=dune%2Caudible%2C402&sr=1-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">DUNE - FRANK HERBERT</a></h4>\n\n<p>Set in the far future amidst a sprawling feudal interstellar empire where planetary dynasties are controlled by noble houses.

One of my new favourites.\nSometimes we need to show some grit and determination. To be the David against Goliath and do the scary things. Mikes example of taking on a bigger business trying to shut him down is a perfect example of realising when you need to just step up your game.\nFRAME YOUR STORIES CORRECTLY\nWe are the result of the stories we tell ourselves and so it’s very important what stories we use to explain what happens in our lives. We covered two very important points around this to ensure that you encourage the best activities from the stories you tell and learn the most you can.\n    - 1 - Try to frame them positively so you can see the best in a situation and not give up. When Mike nearly lost the entire business instead of explaining themselves as incapable idiots who certainly shouldn’t be running a business, they explained it as a big lesson and an example where a plucky young company managed to overcome the big bad guys\n\n    - 2 - On the flipside. Don’t blind yourself from your problems by telling yourself things too positively and believing your own hype. When Mike was struggling with traction and thought his business idea was the answer to everything it took his marketing director to explain that realistically not everyone in the world will need this or be amazed by it and you need to really know who gets exactly what value from it.\nDON’T BOX YOURSELF IN\nThis nicely summarises the last two tips. Mike boxed himself into thinking he needed to use a specific piece of equipment from one supplier. This was a stupid story to tell himself and nearly cost the business. It required ‘Sisu’ to overcome this toxic mindset and open the business to other ways of operating.\nThe reason this is a third tip is that before you even start telling yourself stories or need ‘Sisu’ to get out of a sticky situation you can avoid this by not boxing yourself in in the first place and planning out a business that isn’t reliant on a single break point, whether it is one customer or one supplier or one piece of technology it is always really key to not have all your eggs in one basket that you don’t have control of.\nBOOKS\nGet any of the books free on audible (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00OPA2XFG?tag=samharris48%E2%80%9321)\nDiffusion of Innovations - Everett M.

The idea behind social engineering is to take advantage of a potential victim’s natural tendencies and emotional reactions.\n*Instead of working on months hacking into a company’s system, social engineering would bypass the process which would make life easier for individuals or criminal organizations. Cyber attacks hit businesses every day and have increased every year as people try to benefit from vulnerable business systems. *\nLisa started out taking every role in the company, Red Goat Cyber security, to set as a sample in getting the business off the ground. If she won’t move, no one else will. She mentions that it’s a constant challenge to run your own business, comparing it to taking care of a child that never grows old. It needs constant attention. Lisa also cited her success in public speaking that helped the company gain more clients and, at the same time, elevate herself.\nIf you’re really struggling with something, if there’s a block on something, don’t just necessarily go and look for the obvious solution. Go and look outside the box and try to find someone who might offer you something that blows the barrier that you have.\nLisa believes that the Cyber Security industry will grow exponentially since consumer products being developed nowadays are intertwined with the internet. She mentioned that since almost everything would rely on the internet, this would make users more vulnerable to cyber-attacks.\nHopefully, individuals will start becoming more aware of how they connect with the internet and become more security conscious in the same way you never go out of the house without locking your door.\nLisa brought up that there are 2 types of hackers: black hats and white hats. Some hackers are criminals and use their computer skills to harm or damage computer systems. These people are called black hat hackers. White hat hackers, on the other hand, use their computer skills to perform ethical hacking. Ethical hacking can determine vulnerabilities in a computer system.\nIf companies don't hire white hat hackers to seek out potential threats and find vulnerabilities, there would likely be a lot more cyber crime activity and data breaches.

The idea behind social engineering is to take advantage of a potential victim’s natural tendencies and emotional reactions.</p>\n\n<p>*<em>Instead of working on months hacking into a company’s system, social engineering would bypass the process which would make life easier for individuals or criminal organizations. Cyber attacks hit businesses every day and have increased every year as people try to benefit from vulnerable business systems. *</em></p>\n\n<p>Lisa started out taking every role in the company, Red Goat Cyber security, to set as a sample in getting the business off the ground. If she won’t move, no one else will. She mentions that it’s a constant challenge to run your own business, comparing it to taking care of a child that never grows old. It needs constant attention. Lisa also cited her success in public speaking that helped the company gain more clients and, at the same time, elevate herself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If you’re really struggling with something, if there’s a block on something, don’t just necessarily go and look for the obvious solution. Go and look outside the box and try to find someone who might offer you something that blows the barrier that you have.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lisa believes that the Cyber Security industry will grow exponentially since consumer products being developed nowadays are intertwined with the internet. She mentioned that since almost everything would rely on the internet, this would make users more vulnerable to cyber-attacks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hopefully, individuals will start becoming more aware of how they connect with the internet and become more security conscious in the same way you never go out of the house without locking your door.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lisa brought up that there are 2 types of hackers: black hats and white hats. Some hackers are criminals and use their computer skills to harm or damage computer systems. These people are called black hat hackers. White hat hackers, on the other hand, use their computer skills to perform ethical hacking. Ethical hacking can determine vulnerabilities in a computer system.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If companies don&#39;t hire white hat hackers to seek out potential threats and find vulnerabilities, there would likely be a lot more cyber crime activity and data breaches. It’s basically stepping up their game to make their life challenging.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Our guest talked about the internet becoming a space filled with malicious links, trojans, and viruses. Data breaches are becoming more frequent, and naive users are more vulnerable than ever before. Lisa provided some tips that can help users stay alert and safe online</p>\n\n<p>3 Tips on cyber security</p>\n\n<p>·         Check the information you’ve provided online</p>\n\n<p>·         Make sure to have a firewall and anti-virus from different vendors that update frequently</p>\n\n<p>·         Use a password manager to strengthen your security</p>\n\n<p>Take more responsibility for yourself in the cyber world.

In your business get a non-exec no board and don’t think you're so smart to do it all yourself. There are always things that you can’t think of yourself and you just open yourself up to mistakes by thinking too highly of yourself.\nFOCUS ON SOFT SKILLS\nWhether hiring others or improving yourself its the soft skills that are crucially important. I heard a good point saying the future of work is about the 3 C’s - Communication, collaboration and Creativity. These are the skills you need to have in yourself and in others to be able to work with them. As James says, “you get hired for hard skills —> fired for soft skills” so you must learn to  take feedback and value it.\n“LIFE BEGINS AT THE EDGE OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE”\nIf you want to live an interesting life where you take on challenges and have big successes you need to step out of your comfort zone. Embrace the bigger risks and you will be more likely to succeed in it than if you don’t commit and don’t have the fire under your arse to make it happen.\nBOOKS\nGet any of the books free on audible (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00OPA2XFG?tag=samharris48%E2%80%9321)\nYUVAL NOAH HARARI - 21 LESSONS FOR THE 21ST CENTURY (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lessons-21st-Century-Yuval-Harari/dp/1784708283/ref=sr_1_1?crid=Z1H6Q5JYDQZG&keywords=21+lessons+for+the+21st+century&qid=1580825663&sprefix=21+lessons%2Caps%2C401&sr=8-1)\nAmazing book about what we should really be focusing on and it just opens your eyes into new ways of thinking about things.

Doing anything worthwhile will usually entail some pretty difficult or boring moments at some point or quite a lot of points. You’re much more likely to be successful with anything you do, if something that fundamentally interests you.\nAUTOMATE THE BORING STUFF\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/qjLe77q\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qjLe77q.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nWhen doing something find parts that really don't interest you and take up your time, these will often be holding you back from reaching your potential. You want to find ways to automate them as much as possible.\nFor a bootstrapped entrepreneur this might not be possible straight away but it should be one of your highest priorities as soon as you have the budget. If you can automate your admin and accounts and stuff that just takes your time and isn’t that interesting you can spend more time doing the interesting thing that delivers value and thus build a better business or get more experience in whatever it is you are trying to do.\nIf it turns out the hard boring thing you want to automate is the critical part of the idea or skill that you are working on then clearly this wasn’t a thing that interests you and you should be doing something else.\nBE SELECTIVE OF YOUR CO-FOUNDERS OR CO-WORKERS\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/xIfJvr5\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xIfJvr5.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nDon’t work with anyone just because they sound like they have the right skills. You need to know that you can deeply trust this person, that you both have the same long term goals and that you have the complementary skills. (and also that they don’t have a shady history)\nSo If you don’t already know someone it might be better to work in a non-binding agreement as a test first to see if you really both have the same goals and interests and that it will work long term. It can really help you avoid a messy breakup or issues of silent co-founders dragging you down and of course, hefty legal fee’s to deal with the problem. Richard is doing himself out of a job here.\nBut as he says he would be much rather be helping you scale your business up anyway.\nBONUS TIP: THINK ABOUT YOUR RISKS\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/KgpDBux\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/KgpDBux.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nHis business failure lead to some huge lessons. Don’t take too many loans and leave yourself exposed. Don’t have one point of failure just because a market seems so strong doesn’t mean it will be that way tomorrow. Hedge some of your bets and choose a niche that will be resilient to change.\nBOOKS\nTHE COMPLETE TURTLE TRADER (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Complete-TurtleTrader-Investors-Overnight-Millionaires/dp/0061241717/ref=sr_1_1?crid=126355F8JUHF4&keywords=the+complete+turtle+trader&qid=1580814205&sprefix=the+complete+turt%2Caps%2C447&sr=8-1)\nThis book sounds awesome. It is the real-life version of the movie Trading Places but with 23 participants in the experiment instead of just Eddie Murphy. It sounds like a lot of fascinating insight into the world of trading and redefining What people think of as inherent talent vs. What is just following standard procedures.\nSubscribe!\nIf you enjoyed the podcast please subscribe and rate it.

Doing anything worthwhile will usually entail some pretty difficult or boring moments at some point or quite a lot of points. You’re much more likely to be successful with anything you do, if something that fundamentally interests you.</p>\n\n<h4>AUTOMATE THE BORING STUFF</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/qjLe77q\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qjLe77q.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>When doing something find parts that really don&#39;t interest you and take up your time, these will often be holding you back from reaching your potential. You want to find ways to automate them as much as possible.</p>\n\n<p>For a bootstrapped entrepreneur this might not be possible straight away but it should be one of your highest priorities as soon as you have the budget. If you can automate your admin and accounts and stuff that just takes your time and isn’t that interesting you can spend more time doing the interesting thing that delivers value and thus build a better business or get more experience in whatever it is you are trying to do.</p>\n\n<p>If it turns out the hard boring thing you want to automate is the critical part of the idea or skill that you are working on then clearly this wasn’t a thing that interests you and you should be doing something else.</p>\n\n<h4>BE SELECTIVE OF YOUR CO-FOUNDERS OR CO-WORKERS</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/xIfJvr5\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xIfJvr5.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Don’t work with anyone just because they sound like they have the right skills. You need to know that you can deeply trust this person, that you both have the same long term goals and that you have the complementary skills. (and also that they don’t have a shady history)</p>\n\n<p>So If you don’t already know someone it might be better to work in a non-binding agreement as a test first to see if you really both have the same goals and interests and that it will work long term. It can really help you avoid a messy breakup or issues of silent co-founders dragging you down and of course, hefty legal fee’s to deal with the problem. Richard is doing himself out of a job here.</p>\n\n<p>But as he says he would be much rather be helping you scale your business up anyway.</p>\n\n<h5>BONUS TIP: THINK ABOUT YOUR RISKS</h5>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/KgpDBux\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/KgpDBux.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>His business failure lead to some huge lessons. Don’t take too many loans and leave yourself exposed. Don’t have one point of failure just because a market seems so strong doesn’t mean it will be that way tomorrow. Hedge some of your bets and choose a niche that will be resilient to change.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>BOOKS</h3>\n\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Complete-TurtleTrader-Investors-Overnight-Millionaires/dp/0061241717/ref=sr_1_1?crid=126355F8JUHF4&keywords=the+complete+turtle+trader&qid=1580814205&sprefix=the+complete+turt%2Caps%2C447&sr=8-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">THE COMPLETE TURTLE TRADER</a></h4>\n\n<p>This book sounds awesome. It is the real-life version of the movie Trading Places but with 23 participants in the experiment instead of just Eddie Murphy. It sounds like a lot of fascinating insight into the world of trading and redefining What people think of as inherent talent vs. What is just following standard procedures.</p>\n\n<h2>Subscribe!</h2>\n\n<p>If you enjoyed the podcast please <strong><em>subscribe</em></strong> and <strong><em>rate it</em></strong>.

Agustin is truly a master at just living in the moment and getting the most out of live and living with a purpose he is an incredible example of what a human can do despite everything going against you. \nHis story really puts things in perspective and if you think you have a hard time then you should really pick yourself up. take his advice and move on. \nTRY IDEAS BEFORE IT’S TOO LATE\nAgustin was worried he would become a wage slave for life if he didn’t quit his job and start trying ideas. He had numerous failures and just kept trying out different things till he finally had an idea he was able to get traction on. It’s easy to never take the risk or to give up after you fail but again it’s about not giving up and moving on relentlessly. \nBE MINDFUL OF OTHERS\nAgustin mentioned he tried to be mindful of others and I can tell you from direct experience he really is. You can’t tell from this released podcast but actually this original recording was over an hour long and boy did i murder this interview. Agustin had such incredible tips but I kept on asking stupid questions or missing the point, not helped by the fact that I was under way too much self inflicted workload stress and generally too busy.

Trust me it didn’t happen like that at all. </p>\n\n<p>So yea cool  guy and you can really help others and turns out yourself by being nice to them </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>BOOKS</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00OPA2XFG?tag=samharris48%E2%80%9321\" rel=\"nofollow\">Get any of the books free on audible</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alchemist-Fable-About-Following-Dream/dp/B0055HVN04/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2TJ1TURGWM8K1&keywords=the+alchemist&qid=1580811666&s=books&sprefix=The+alche%2Caudible%2C456&sr=1-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">THE ALCHEMIST - PAULO COELHO </a><br>\nSantiago&#39;s journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, of recognising opportunity and learning to read the omens strewn along life&#39;s path, and, most importantly, to follow our dreams.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Beyond-Entrepreneurship-Turning-Business-Enduring/dp/0133815269/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2LD1A5TKY70H1&keywords=beyond+entrepreneurship&qid=1580811707&sprefix=beyond+entre%2Caudible%2C382&sr=8-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">BEYOND ENTREPRENEURSHIP -  JAMES C.

It is the kindest thing you can do for yourself and others by just laying yourself bare and being vulnerable and honest.\nBE CAREFUL WHAT INVESTMENT YOU ACCEPT\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/fNLM20f\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fNLM20f.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nTheir first offer they had to reject, by holding out they got into Techstars and later the investment from a Russian VC who gave them much more support as they were aligned with the goals of DataSine.\nThis is an easy one to say but to actually do in practice is a lot harder when you haven’t got a bunch of different investors to  choose from. It requires some real bravery to reject people if you aren’t sure if you’ll get another offer. But try to ensure your goals and the investors goals are as similar as possible \nDON’T COMPARE YOURSELF TO OTHERS\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/je2LIPW\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/je2LIPW.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nI don’t think I’ll ever forget the story of the Indian kids being so happy they got a football and could stop kicking rocks around.

Our happiness is a very weird thing that is highly affected to the context of the people around you instead of focussing purely on how lucky you are for the things you have. \nSo don’t compare yourself to others or feel entitled to things that you have no business being entitled to and just chill out a bit and remember to think how much worse things could be. Instead think about how much you can be grateful for. \nIt will do you the world of good \nTAKE BIG RISKS\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/BoNkgcl\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BoNkgcl.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n“The biggest risk in life is doing something you don’t like in the hope you might learn to enjoy it” - Igor Volzhanin\nI love this quote so much! We risk missing out on so much in life by just doing the things we are presented with and by not taking chances. By letting our fear of the unknown control us we often never find things that truly make us happy and it is so important to take seemingly big risks less we run the biggest risk of all of having never truly lived. \nBOOKS\nGet any of the books free on audible (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00OPA2XFG?tag=samharris48%E2%80%9321)\n 33 STRATEGIES OF WAR - ROBERT GREENE (https://www.amazon.co.uk/33-Strategies-of-War/dp/B0127SDIIS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=26ZY07JBGA5N9&keywords=33+strategies+of+war&qid=1580810361&s=books&sprefix=33+stra%2Caudible%2C387&sr=1-1)\nBrilliant distillations of the strategies of war—and the subtle social game of everyday life\nTHE WAY OF THE SUPERIOR MAN - DAVID DIEDA (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Way-Superior-Man-Challenges-Anniversary-ebook/dp/B01NA993PI/ref=sr_1_1?crid=X3B4GZAZB0UX&keywords=the+way+of+the+superior+man&qid=1580810391&s=digital-text&sprefix=the+way+of+the+su%2Caudible%2C401&sr=1-1)\nThis book explores the most important issues in men's lives—from career and family to women and intimacy to love and spirituality and relationships—to offer a practical guidebook for living a masculine life of integrity, authenticity, and freedom.

He started a photography business to commemorate the precious memories and reminders of people dear to someone. He was inclined to the business idea of import-export because he had a feeling that this could be a good way to grow a business.\nDo stuff because you really want to do it, and not because you’re told to do it.\nAlways wanting to be in control of his destiny and start his own business, Nicholas cites execution as a “big thing.”  Start with execution and subsequently define your strategy. You don’t want to be the leader who overpromises only to under-deliver. Prioritizing execution requires you to think of your business strategy a living, evolving entity, meaning you’ll routinely revisit, reanalyze and make updates based on how things are going in real-time.\nThe idea is not the big thing. It’s always about execution. You look around a room and there are a 101 business ideas in any room. You just got to do it better than anybody else. Better quality, better value, better sale.\nThrough traveling, Nicholas was able to start a shoe business. As he garnered clients, Nicholas had to manufacture his products internationally because of the quality he deemed fit for his business. After experiencing business lessons, Nicholas turned to “Charles Tyrwhitt,” a menswear clothing line built to last. He mentioned that when starting a business, the first couple of years should all be about learning your customers, your product and your business. He has given recognition on the times when his business would try to go do more things for growth, to which it has cost them setbacks. Charles Tyrwhitt improved in time especially with the development of the internet.\nWhen the internet did come along, I knew it was going to be very important for the business. It changed mail order from the down and dirty to being quite sexy.\nNicholas points out that the key to every business’s success is focusing on the things that one is good at. The key to success might be focus, but don’t forget to believe in your dreams. Success is limitless when Focus is the driver and never take your mind off your dreams. \nYou don’t just think it’s going to work, you know it is going to work. When you’re bored, you tend to lose focus. Just be mature on focusing on the one thing and be the best for you to get a business working. Focus is an incredible part of success.\nNicholas took the time to invest himself in taking more work than they can handle rather than delegating tasks to his employees. As a humble leader, he appreciates the strengths of each employee and trusts them to do effective work to help move the company forward. He also mentions seeking feedback to improve processes, company culture and other areas of the business.\nI have never thought that I am the best person to run the business. I have always felt that other people could run the business better. I want to be with people who are going to be fun, people who can be uplifting. You got to have that positive mental attitude.\nOur guest’s goal has always been to make Charles Tyrwhitt the best shirt company in the world. Don’t get discouraged if you can’t define your essence this instant. This is often a long process that happens in fits and starts. Be patient, and let the answers come organically.\nAs you get more experience and as you get exposed to more wisdom, you become a better judger at people… You got to understand the essence of your business, and what is it the people will like and not like about it.\nTOP TIPS\nBE HUMBLE\nNick is very humble and accepting of his mistakes. He would often start with comments such as ’this has been said before i’m not a genius for thinking it’ or ‘this is what i think but sure it’s not always the case.’\nWhich doesn’t undermine his thoughts exactly it just shows he is open to being challenged or that there could be other opinions that are right. \nHe is completely open to being wrong and actively encourages his employees to challenge him and the authority across the organisation to ensure that people have a say in decisions and understand why things are the way they are or have the power to change them \nFOCUS - PERSEVERANCE\nDon’t quit when starting. Finding traction and getting things going takes time to become and expert at what you do and understand who your customer is and how to serve them. the world doesn’t just stop and buy into your idea when you launch, so you shouldn’t just give up. \nAnd then when you’ve finally solved a problem don’t quit. zero to 10 is the hardest thing. 10 to 100 is much easier yet so many people do quit \nDon’t lose attention and try other things because you’ll just mess up what you are doing. \nAwesome notes provided by Aditya Behere (https://twitter.com/BehereBaba)!\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/zpBQ23v\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zpBQ23v.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nDON’T BE AFRAID TO BREAK THE MOULD\nFor a “traditional business” Nick hasn’t done anything traditionally. He didn’t take financing or find a business partner. he launched at the time a very innovative business model and ignored all his friends telling him to get a real job and give up on the mail order shirt thing. \nIn hindsight, it might all seem quite easy but at the time it takes real courage to be different. Sometimes you have to zag when everyone is zigging and have the courage to do something everyone thinks is stupid.\nKey Discussion Points\n[2:50] First business idea\n[6:01] Business Execution\n[11:30] Importance of starting a business\n[22:28] Focus as a key to growing\n[28:16] Learning on how to improve the mindset on dealing with problems\n[35:44] Signs Nicholas look for from people\n[40:26] Advantages of having a wife that has a similar business\nBOOKS\nGet any of the books free on audible (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00OPA2XFG?tag=samharris48%E2%80%9321)\nDAMAGED GOODS - THE INSIDE STORY OF SIR PHILLIP GREEN, AND THE COLLAPSE OF BHS, AND THE DEATH OF THE HIGH STREET - OLIVER SHAH (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Damaged-Goods-Inside-Philip-Collapse/dp/0241341183/ref=sr_1_1?crid=22L7XOAXUG7V5&keywords=damaged+goods&qid=1580629667&s=books&sprefix=damag%2Cstripbooks%2C350&sr=1-1)\nSir Philip Green was once hailed one of Britain's best businessmen.

When you think of things from other peoples perspectives instead from your own perspective you really unlock a whole extra dimension of happiness that never even existed before and its suddenly becomes remarkably easy to enjoy each day instead of going through life selfishly trying to have more for yourself or feeling owed stuff or victimised when you don’t get as much as others instead of feeling happy that other people are doing well. \nThis also makes you are much nicer person to be around and then other people start doing nice things for you and your life and relationships get a whole lot better.\nBob thinks that the ability to be generous should be considered a privilege that you shouldn’t take for granted and should use at all times:\n1 - The fact you can give anything is a privilege. even just a smile is a privilege that you are happy. giving anything of value is a privilege that you have something of value.\n2 - Being able to give to others because they are open to receive is also a privilege. Not everyone in life is ready to receive help or advice or any form of gifts from you. So when people are open to generosity you can be grateful that you are able to improve their day.\nThen to conclude with his biggest philosophy - Having what you need is enough and having more is awesome because you get to give to others.\n <a href=\"https://imgur.com/sJcBgA9\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sJcBgA9.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nHAPPINESS THROUGH LIVING IN THE MOMENT AND JUST DECIDING TO BE HAPPY\nDon’t let your expectations of what you want control your happiness. when shit things happen accept them and just move on without being dragged into unhappiness, like Bob and his new kitchen or me and my parking ticket. If you accept reality as it is straight away you can continue to be happy and have good relationships with the people around you. If you kick and scream like a child resisting acceptance of this new fate that has befallen you and blaming those around or shouting at people you are just being stupid, you have to accept this new situation you are in eventually and you are just wasting time.\nIf a problem arises and you let that make you unhappy and get angry or sad, instead of having one problem you create many more problems for yourself and waste your own time being unhappy about life and waste time of others being a dick and life is simply too short too waste with this so just don’t. and then life is much better.\nAnd as a bonus when you observe the fact that you could be unhappy right now but have decided not to be, you feel even happier because you aware of how much crap you are avoiding.  \nI appreciate that this is super easy to say and super hard to do. Like i learnt my lesson with the parking ticket ten years ago but still didn’t become great at practicing it till more recently. Some people certainly feel like they are supposed to get angry when someone does them wrong and like it’s violating their principles letting someone get away with something. but if you can look at the big picture and see how much benefit and negative you truly get from following these negative emotions it just always works out worst for yourself. Like buddhist say. ‘Holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other man to get sick'\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/9zbVbnj\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9zbVbnj.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nSTAY TRUE TO YOUR BELIEFS\nWhen something makes you feel awkward and you know it's wrong yet you feel like it can’t be changed and those around you aren’t doing anything. Don’t just carry on. Have the balls to stick your neck out and risk it. Bob saved patients money and impressed his bosses by being the one willing to tell them about the issues going on with doctors stealing money from patients. He risked being not understood or losing sales of the product for his company by doctors no longer using their products. But he stood up for his belief and the patients and everything worked out.\nI think we all have times when our morale beliefs are challenged and examples like this are a great reason to have faith in ourselves instead of just following the crowd.\nBOOKS\nGet any of the books free on audible (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00OPA2XFG?tag=samharris48%E2%80%9321)\nREPLAY - KEN GRIMWOOD (https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=replay+ken+grimwood&i=stripbooks&crid=34URPC1UQLI34&sprefix=replay+%2Cstripbooks%2C361&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_7)\nThe tale of a man who is reborn several times into his same body as a teenager and provides a great perspective on the way someone can choose to live a life.

When you think of things from other peoples perspectives instead from your own perspective you really unlock a whole extra dimension of happiness that never even existed before and its suddenly becomes remarkably easy to enjoy each day instead of going through life selfishly trying to have more for yourself or feeling owed stuff or victimised when you don’t get as much as others instead of feeling happy that other people are doing well. </p>\n\n<p>This also makes you are much nicer person to be around and then other people start doing nice things for you and your life and relationships get a whole lot better.</p>\n\n<p>Bob thinks that the ability to be generous should be considered a privilege that you shouldn’t take for granted and should use at all times:</p>\n\n<p>1 - The fact you can give anything is a privilege. even just a smile is a privilege that you are happy. giving anything of value is a privilege that you have something of value.</p>\n\n<p>2 - Being able to give to others because they are open to receive is also a privilege. Not everyone in life is ready to receive help or advice or any form of gifts from you. So when people are open to generosity you can be grateful that you are able to improve their day.</p>\n\n<p>Then to conclude with his biggest philosophy - <em>Having what you need is enough and having more is awesome because you get to give to others.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/sJcBgA9\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sJcBgA9.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>HAPPINESS THROUGH LIVING IN THE MOMENT AND JUST DECIDING TO BE HAPPY</h4>\n\n<p>Don’t let your expectations of what you want control your happiness. when shit things happen accept them and just move on without being dragged into unhappiness, like Bob and his new kitchen or me and my parking ticket. If you accept reality as it is straight away you can continue to be happy and have good relationships with the people around you. If you kick and scream like a child resisting acceptance of this new fate that has befallen you and blaming those around or shouting at people you are just being stupid, you have to accept this new situation you are in eventually and you are just wasting time.</p>\n\n<p>If a problem arises and you let that make you unhappy and get angry or sad, instead of having one problem you create many more problems for yourself and waste your own time being unhappy about life and waste time of others being a dick and life is simply too short too waste with this so just don’t. and then life is much better.</p>\n\n<p>And as a bonus when you observe the fact that you could be unhappy right now but have decided not to be, you feel even happier because you aware of how much crap you are avoiding.  </p>\n\n<p>I appreciate that this is super easy to say and super hard to do. Like i learnt my lesson with the parking ticket ten years ago but still didn’t become great at practicing it till more recently. Some people certainly feel like they are supposed to get angry when someone does them wrong and like it’s violating their principles letting someone get away with something. but if you can look at the big picture and see how much benefit and negative you truly get from following these negative emotions it just always works out worst for yourself. Like buddhist say. ‘Holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other man to get sick&#39;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/9zbVbnj\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9zbVbnj.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<h4>STAY TRUE TO YOUR BELIEFS</h4>\n\n<p>When something makes you feel awkward and you know it&#39;s wrong yet you feel like it can’t be changed and those around you aren’t doing anything. Don’t just carry on. Have the balls to stick your neck out and risk it. Bob saved patients money and impressed his bosses by being the one willing to tell them about the issues going on with doctors stealing money from patients. He risked being not understood or losing sales of the product for his company by doctors no longer using their products. But he stood up for his belief and the patients and everything worked out.</p>\n\n<p>I think we all have times when our morale beliefs are challenged and examples like this are a great reason to have faith in ourselves instead of just following the crowd.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>BOOKS</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00OPA2XFG?tag=samharris48%E2%80%9321\" rel=\"nofollow\">Get any of the books free on audible</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=replay+ken+grimwood&i=stripbooks&crid=34URPC1UQLI34&sprefix=replay+%2Cstripbooks%2C361&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_7\" rel=\"nofollow\">REPLAY - KEN GRIMWOOD</a><br>\nThe tale of a man who is reborn several times into his same body as a teenager and provides a great perspective on the way someone can choose to live a life.

It’s really frustrating to end in failure and have wasted a bunch of time and money you’ll never get back going nowhere.\nI have been recording podcasts for nearly two years and running this show for over a year. I have been running side projects since I can remember with plenty of success and failure and a whole bunch of lessons learnt. There is plenty still to learn and I don't want to pretend I am the ultimate master at any of them or at learning. However, there are some common themes I’ve noticed with my own projects and those of people who have done started their own with success.\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/kXrfChN\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kXrfChN.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nSIDE PROJECT SUCCESS\nI break down some of the most important things to make your side project or hobby a successful endeavour that gives you benefits back in learning skills, making connections or growing a business. \nhttps://perrytheva.imgur.com/all/?third_party=1\nPODCAST SUCCESS (AND PITFALLS)\nIn the second half of the episode, I dive deeper into specific lessons and surprises I've learnt from running a podcast that I wish I had been aware of when I started.\nI do not claim to have a multi-million pound podcast and to be living the dream just yet. But I hit my targets for year 1 of getting 100k downloads and $100 per episode (despite them being slightly arbitrary). More importantly I got to do a bunch of really cool shit and meet awesome people and satisfy my curiosity urges. I created a brand and a podcast that now opens doors for me across the world.\nI won’t pretend to give good advice on how to secure the best advertising, or get a million listeners as I simply haven’t done this.

There are lots of tricks and hacks people publish to help you get more out of life but I have never come across any article mentioning Touch Typing.\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/jbsBPjZ\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jbsBPjZ.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nTouch Typing has been a completely overlooked skill that is quite possibly one of the best life hacks anyone can learn without making any radical changes to your life or redefining who you are or anything.\nLearning to meditate or going to the gym every day and getting better sleep is for sure great for you, but I’m not sure if it’s even a life hack so I don’t know why Life-Hack lists are always full of them. And for any of those things to be effective you have to learn to actually enjoy doing them, otherwise, it’s just a short-term thing that takes effort and doesn’t change your life in any way at all.\nSo although learning to Touch Type may sound like perhaps the least sexy life-hack anyone has ever mentioned, I believe it is a truly universal life hack that will pay you back in benefits for the rest of your life, regardless of any personal preferences for pizza or salad, FIFA or yoga etc. Hopefully, this has convinced you enough to go ahead and read the rest of this post below to understand why I believe it is so awesome.\nTOUCH TYPING DEFINITION\nTouch Typing is the ability to type into a computer relying on touch alone. You never need to look down at the keyboard. You can type using purely muscle memory and no longer use ‘active’ thinking to work out how to type letters and words.\nThis means that, in the long run, you can type much faster without the constraints of looking down at the keys and flicking back up to the screen to see what you typed. This can let you progress onto skills such as being able to transcribe audio as it happens and to make notes super fast, or just be able to write emails in the dark or whilst talking to someone else you can carry on working.\nMY BACKGROUND\nI have been typing regularly for the past 20 years. I even did a bit of touch typing at school to help learn the keyboard. I type relatively fast and never really thought of it as something I needed to improve. I have one mate who types crazy fast and when he types he looks like a wizard. But, to be honest, the speed that words appear on his computer never really filled me with envy and I assumed my life was just fine.\nMy typing style involves using most of my fingers so half way to touch typing. I guess I do glance down at the keyboard a lot just to check where keys are. I have definitely reached a plateau at typing speed but thought that was fine.\nAfter a conversation with Alex Denne on the podcast (https://growthmindset.fireside.fm/2018-alex-denne), he sent me a link to a touch typing tutorial (https://www.typingclub.com/). It had a nice UI and the gamification within the app was cool and for ten minutes a day, I thought why not try it.\nBENEFITS\nYou really don’t know what you don’t know, and I hadn’t realized in the slightest how much my typing style was slowing me down in so many other ways (besides just my words per minute rate).\nFEWER ERRORS\nTouch typing means you can be watching the screen the whole time for errors, as such I make about 80% fewer errors in my typing straight away. This is amazing in itself and makes my writing and emailing much better, There is less time needed for checking and less stupid errors getting through which make me appear a complete sloppy dumbass\nFREE THOUGHT\nThis is something I really hadn’t expected. But typing with the help of your eyes to check where keys are actual takes a portion of conscious effort dedicated to just the action of typing. By moving the act of typing into the unconscious side of the brain, this frees up your mind to think more openly about other things. This has two great benefits.\nWhen you are no longer worried about typing the immediate words right now you start being able to think about the words ahead. I would say it’s like learning to drive.\nCAR DRIVING ANALOGY\nWhen you first try to drive you only look at the road immediately in front of you and your brain is thinking, “crap I need to move the wheel and change gear and change how much I’m pressing the pedals and Oh God 😱 there’s someone coming and I need to go round a corner”. And you generally mess it all up and can never plan ahead and you feel like a noob.\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/TVOlvsW\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/TVOlvsW.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nOnce you learn to master all these different things and automate them in your sub-conscience you start to look much further ahead and see how the road turns. You can already plan ahead what gear you should be in when arriving and your body starts doing things naturally to fit all the adjustments into your plan as you go along rather than reacting to it. You are able to stay aware of potential hazards and enjoy a pleasant conversation or daydreaming or singing along as you drive along just fine. You are not stuck in an endless cycle of focusing only on the immediate road just ahead of you and scrambling to try and do the right thing right now.\nIt’s the same when you know how to touch type. You can stop thinking about how to put your finger on the right letter at the right time. You don’t need to focus on where a particular letter is on the keyboard and get each word out one by one. You can think about the entire body of thoughts that are in your head and how you are going to distill it into a sensible text\nCREATIVITY\nWhen you are no longer writing with a slight disability, you can dedicate your full brain space to the act of thinking about the sentence you want to write. You can also think more long term as you go along about the story you want to tell and genuinely become a better and more creative writer by removing this limitation.\nIf you have a great idea, you can write it down immediately instead of focusing on how to type the words to express your idea.\nSOCIAL\nThis sounds silly, but people often try to talk to you whilst your typing and it can end up in a total mess in two ways, either:\nYou stop what you are doing and dedicate your full mental energy to the person. This is very polite but then you might forget what you were doing and have to start again.\nYou try to carry on finishing your train of thought whilst keeping the other person on hold in a weird limbo where you give them enough info to keep them there but don’t really tell them anything useful. You finish off your email or idea but it takes longer because you are also talking to the other person and its all a bit rude and both the writing and conversation suck.\nWith touch typing, you have more brain space available to finish off your typing whilst also listening to the person and answering them in full “real English” sentences, and you can even look at them whilst you do it. Amazing!\nFUTURE THOUGHTS\nIncreasing accuracy of speech to text and news about projects like Nueralink (brain-machine interface to connect humans and computers) grabbing headlines might make you think there is no point in learning this skill if it will become a relic in the future.\nBack to the** “Driving analogy”**.\nPeople may not consider learning to drive in 2018 on the presumption that driverless cars are coming out in the near future and all cars will be driverless. Learning to drive is expensive, time-consuming, dangerous and quite frankly a little embarrassing. So why bother unless you live somewhere rural and really need to transport yourself right now.\nBut for touch typing, I do not agree with this argument of wasted time due to future tech making the skill pointless.\nFirstly, the investment to learn is much smaller. You can learn touch typing for free! And it doesn’t take half as many hours. And you can’t kill yourself or anyone else whilst doing it. 😆\nSecondly, there will still be plenty of occasions when the technology isn’t ready or appropriate and traditional “old-school” typing will still apply. Even when once speech-to-text is 100% accurate and people think, hey I can just speak all day and never type, what will actually happen next? We will have to wait 20 years for every office ever to be completely re-designed to let you sit in your own bunker of silence so that you can work with just your computer, instead of working with other people. Except that’s a crap idea and if I’m in an office I want to be able to talk to other people and I really don’t want to hear them talking to their computers all day every day. Every email or document should not be read out loud to the whole office by all my colleagues as they try to decide what to write!\nIf you’ve ever used Alexa, or Siri or Google Voice etc… then I’m sure you know that feeling when someone starts talking to it and everyone else goes quiet whilst this takes place. It is unnatural and totally not a viable option for real work.\nThe fact is you will be typing a lot of the time, even if you won’t need to type as much of the time.\nAnd brain-computer interface Neuroprosthetics such as Nueralink despite being super mega awesome fantastic would still take a long time to become practically usable.\nYou should just embrace the old school version of depositing thoughts from your mind and uploading these thoughts to others via written down text. By learning to touch type and getting familiar with your keyboard, you can make this flow of consciousness as seamless as possible and experience the liberation it provides!\nSUMMARY\nTouch typing releases brain space by moving conscious thought into the subconscious so you can think more freely about more stuff, and then get that stuff down into writing faster. So you become a more creative and more productive person at the same time.\nIt doesn’t take long to learn and can be acquired over a month with just 5–10 minutes of active work on it a day. And this time you will quickly get back as you can type and think much faster during your working day.\nNot learning to touch type is basically hindering your entire ability to work efficiently if you are a human being who works at all with computers.\nSo whether you are a writer, CEO, secretary or a student. My number one life hack for 2018 is learning to touch Type.\nLINKS\nTOUCH TYPING\nI really enjoyed www.typingclub.com as a great site to learn touch typing for free.

Actually most of them are pretty damn chill about the entire affair and happy going about their lives and walking their dogs. They certainly live modest lives and don’t have a lot of money as a nation, but they aren’t distracted by social media and all that crap the whole time and if you rushed in trying to save them they’d look at you like your bonkers. It is scary the way news controls our lives and thoughts and the way it makes us percieve them. We of course are very aware of the influence of north korean news on it’s own people which is of course very controlling, yet we pay little attention to our own news and it’s influence on us.\nI’ve been really enjoyed reading the book ‘Factfullness’ by Hans Rosling which is one of the most informative books about the world around you. He gives an example of an Englishman going to Mexico City which is apparently one of the most dangerous places and yet the people there were scared to visit London because they’d heard of stabbings and crime and riots. and this happened to me exactly when i visited and the book is just full of funny facts we get completely wrong about how bad the world is and is a very positive book to help you question the reality of what your being told.\nQUESTION NORMALITY\nBeing shut of from most of society they have a very different impression of normal. As a nation of skinny people they found fat people an amazingly rare and hilarious thing to observe. When a train gets delayed this is a perfect opportunity for everyone to practice a group dance so why just waste time standing around when you could be dancing. They also believe that dark chocolate will make you black and white chocolate will make you white. So one, never buy a north korean lady dark chocolate as a present. and think twice before tucking into your favorite white chocolate bar before chowing down on a milkbar before you lose your tan. That’s something the scientist never warned you about\nTHE WORLD IS GETTING MUCH SMALLER\nWith the increasing wealth of all nations and decreasing cost of travel the number of tourists is exploding. Places like North Korea and Eritrea and starting to be able to have their own tourism industry as people increasingly want rare and unusual experiences beyond the normal and completely overdone options offered on package holidays where you are just one of a million people doing the same thing.\nAgain going back to the Hans Rosling book there are two ways of looking at this. It’s easy to see the overabundance of people at tourist attractions as annoying and a problem. But it’s actually amazing that so many more people are able to afford to take time off work and enjoy their money and go away and relax.\nI was really surprised to meet rich North Korean on the train into and out of China who were going on shopping holidays for the latest fashion and things. It was a concept that hadn’t even entered my brain as possible  \nMOST THINGS AREN’T THE END OF THE WORLD. YOU REALLY DON’T NEED TO STRESS - A BIT OF RESILIENCE AND IT’S ALL FINE!\nTravelling opens your eyes in many ways as I’ve shown. But one of the best things is when everything goes completely wrong and the most terrible stuff happens. and yet you still walk away fine having had this completely bonkers experience. It genuinely makes you feel like there’s no point worrying about anything. Ben’s experience being stranded on different borders or my experience being arrested in Paraguay feels like it’s the end of the world. and yet it all ends up okay. I can only liken it to jumping of a skyscraper and expecting to go splat and then just landing on the floor a little awkard and then picking yourself up and feeling a bit silly and walking off scratching you head wandering why you’ve been lied to in every single physics lesson.\nI really think the north koreans are possibly the most resilient people ever. Whether they’ve had self imposed disasters or problems imposed on them they keep picking themselves up and carrying on without worrying to much about it. They had literally all their personal savings wiped out 10 years ago when the currency was replaced with a new official currency and they weren’t allowed to swap more than $50 dollars of their savings into the new currency or something. Sure it’s a disaster and super bad thing that the government did, but it’s also amazing that the people were able to deal with this  and just move on and find happiness in their lives, and if you can get over that you can probably get over anything. And i guess this was the kind of wierd thing that I genuinely felt like on average the north koreans were mostly happier. perhaps they just stopped giving a fuck and you can’t break someone who doesn’t care. \nSo we can all learn to be a little bit more happy for whatever we do have and not worry about things that don’t go away. So thanks North Korea for showing me that and I hope it helps you be happier also!\nBOOKS\nBARBARA DEMICK - NOTHING TO ENVY (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nothing-Envy-Lives-North-Korea/dp/184708141X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=nothing+to+envy&qid=1580473042&s=books&sr=1-1)\nAmazing book about lives of several north korean famalies and what they went through and expereinces defecting from the country.

This book really shows what is going on in the world and why we should find more reasons to be grateful rather then waste so much time whining about all our problems and pining for the past that was actually much worse than our current situation. \nContact Us\nYou can find out more about us and chat about anything you like\nBen:\nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-johnson-%E8%94%A1%E5%93%B2%E6%98%8E-70496b85/)\nSam:\nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/samjamsnaps/)\nQuora (https://www.quora.com/profile/Sam-Harris-58)\nTwitter (https://twitter.com/samharristweets)\nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharris48/)\nSam's blog - SamWebsterHarris.com (https://samwebsterharris.com/)\nSupport the Show - Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/growthmindset)\nSubscribe!\nIf you enjoyed the podcast please subscribe and rate it.

But it’s actually amazing that so many more people are able to afford to take time off work and enjoy their money and go away and relax.</p>\n\n<p>I was really surprised to meet rich North Korean on the train into and out of China who were going on shopping holidays for the latest fashion and things. It was a concept that hadn’t even entered my brain as possible  </p>\n\n<h3>MOST THINGS AREN’T THE END OF THE WORLD. YOU REALLY DON’T NEED TO STRESS - A BIT OF RESILIENCE AND IT’S ALL FINE!</h3>\n\n<p>Travelling opens your eyes in many ways as I’ve shown. But one of the best things is when everything goes completely wrong and the most terrible stuff happens. and yet you still walk away fine having had this completely bonkers experience. It genuinely makes you feel like there’s no point worrying about anything. Ben’s experience being stranded on different borders or my experience being arrested in Paraguay feels like it’s the end of the world. and yet it all ends up okay. I can only liken it to jumping of a skyscraper and expecting to go splat and then just landing on the floor a little awkard and then picking yourself up and feeling a bit silly and walking off scratching you head wandering why you’ve been lied to in every single physics lesson.</p>\n\n<p>I really think the north koreans are possibly the most resilient people ever. Whether they’ve had self imposed disasters or problems imposed on them they keep picking themselves up and carrying on without worrying to much about it. They had literally all their personal savings wiped out 10 years ago when the currency was replaced with a new official currency and they weren’t allowed to swap more than $50 dollars of their savings into the new currency or something. Sure it’s a disaster and super bad thing that the government did, but it’s also amazing that the people were able to deal with this  and just move on and find happiness in their lives, and if you can get over that you can probably get over anything. And i guess this was the kind of wierd thing that I genuinely felt like on average the north koreans were mostly happier. perhaps they just stopped giving a fuck and you can’t break someone who doesn’t care. </p>\n\n<p>So we can all learn to be a little bit more happy for whatever we do have and not worry about things that don’t go away. So thanks North Korea for showing me that and I hope it helps you be happier also!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>BOOKS</h4>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nothing-Envy-Lives-North-Korea/dp/184708141X/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=nothing+to+envy&qid=1580473042&s=books&sr=1-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">BARBARA DEMICK - NOTHING TO ENVY</a></strong><br>\nAmazing book about lives of several north korean famalies and what they went through and expereinces defecting from the country.

Yet most people don't even know what it is. Sam breaks down what the effect is, from how it was discovered to what you can do about it.\nThis episode helps us learn more traits to boost our growth mindset with the goal of making you a more positive and strategic thinker able to look at the bigger picture and less caught up in the problems life throws at us.\nBACKGROUND\nIt was discovered by Marting Seligman. He restrained dogs in a box  and then gave them an electric shock at the same time as ringing a bell. After repeating this the dogs learned they would get a shock every time they heard the bell.\nHe then put them in a box with a small fence they could jump over. on the other side of the fence would not get a shock when the bell rang. However, when the bell rang they just cowered and accepted the shock.\nIf he put a different dog in the box that had not received the electric shocks before it would try to escape and quickly learn that when the bell rang it would be safe on one side of the box and not on the other.\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/9n8EWi6\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9n8EWi6.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nThis has been demonstrated with other animal studies such as rats and even elephants and just in teh last few years in zebrafish and tree-shrews. \nThey found that elelphant trainers would tie a young elephant to a post and it would struggle to try and escape the rope. For hours and days they might pull against it before giving up. However, once they gave up they wouldn’t test it again. So once teh elephant becomes an adult that can rip up tree’s and knock down walls, if you tie it to the post it was tied to as a child it gives up and sits down until it’s released. amazing!\nLEARNED HELPLESSNESS IN HUMANS\nLearned helplessness in extreme scenarios has not been experimented on with humans but it has been proven to be similar to those observed in animals although there are more complicated factors at hand and they found two types of helplessness can arise.\nOriginal Experiment\nIn one experiment they had three cases for the human test subjects.\nOne group heard a loud noise and had a button in front of them. they needed to press the button 4 times to make it stop and they usually worked this out pretty fast.\na second group had the same noise and hte same button. but when pressed the button did nothing and the subjects soon stopped bothering with the pointless button\na third group had no noise at all.\nIn the second test all participants heard a similar loud noise and had a box with a lever in front of them. When manipulated the lever turned off the noise.\nGroups 1 and 3 learned to turn off the noise quickly. group 2 who had become used to not being ablt to turn off the noise mostly didn’t try the lever and sat with an annoying noise playing.\nDeficits of Helplessness\nThey deduced that learned helplessness creates three deficits in subjects, cognitive, motivational and emotional:\nCognitive - the subject has the idea in their mind that their circumstances are uncontrollable\nMotivational - meaning that the subject doesn’t bother to respond to potential methods of escaping a negative situation\nEmotional - the subject takes on a depressed state when they are placed in a negative situation they cannot control\nTWO TYPES OF HELPLESSNESS\nLearned helplessness in humans can have two types. Universal helplessness and personal helplessness\nUniversal helplessness is a sense of helplessness where the subject believes nothing can be done about the situation, no one can help alleviate the pain or discomfort.\nPersonal helplessness is where the person believes that others may be able to find a solution or to avoid the pain or discomfort but that they are not personally capable of finding a solution.\nBoth can lead to a state of depression but with different qualities.\nUniversal helplessness leads to explanation of the problem being due to external factors that they can’t solve, whereas personal helplessness will tend to be explained due to internal reasons.\nAs such personal helplessness is associated with a lower sense of self-esteem and can have a greater emotional impact.\nNeither are great and experiencing either is a bad place to be. They are more likely to arise when we are anxious or under stress and then just naturally over-time we are more likely to accumulate learned helplessness traits as we get older due to two fundamental laws of nature\nas time passes we are exposed to more situations where learned helplessness can arise\nas time passes our bodies age and we experience more loss of abilities and health complications, some of which are reversible yet they get accepted.\nAs well as the immediate issues of not helping ourselves in the given situation it also has negative effects such as burnout, Depression, anxiety, phobias, shyness, and loneliness\nCOMMON LEARNED HELPLESSNESS EXAMPLES\nCHILDREN IN SCHOOL\nOften a child performs badly in one topic, math or in my case languages. They perform poorly compared to the rest of the class and the teacher doesn’t provide useful examples the student can learn from or faith in the student that they can do better. The student gets used to being bad at the subject and only get’s worse and pays less attention in lessons and completes homework in a more resigned manner expecting to do badly. They lose confidence to use the skills in the rest of their live. i.e. a bad math student never has confidence to work with figures or a bad language student never tries to learn a new language and assumes they will not be able to.  \nExample\nMy friend who first told me about learned helplessness used to be bad at english, when he was a t school in Germany he had one teacher who gave him his test results back once and told him he’d never be any good at english and that he was a stupid child. like seriously WTF was this guy being a teacher but the effect was really damaging on my friends motivation to even try and get better at english so he always approached it with an attitude that he wouldn’t learn much and struggled even more than he needed to. Luckily Germans basically have to study english forever so he went on to become pretty much fluent, however, he still had really low confidence for a long time even when he was pretty much fluent until he found out about learned helplessness and how silly his mindset was.\nSHYNESS\nAnother common example is shyness. People who feel shy in social situations can eventually feel there is nothing they can do to overcome their symptoms. When the believe their symptoms our outside of their control this can lead to them not engaging in social situations and making the shyness even more pronounced and compounding effects of anxiety and stress around the situation so they avoid it even more.\nI personally have suffered from shyness and language learning difficulties. but where i first encountered learned helplessness was with coding\nMY FIRST HELPLESSNESS QUALITY - CODING\nI realised my first ‘learned helplessness’ quality whilst my co-founder was teaching me some programming techniques for a new front end framework we we  re writing. I am more the business guy that has just got into coding and not exactly the core developer here but I can code. However, as he was teaching me and giving me tasks to do I was constantly asking more questions whenever I became stuck or didn’t understand something. I didn’t have a lot of confidence in the code I was writing and generally made the assumption that what I was doing was probably wrong. I’d literally internalised that I was a bit of an idiot. He sat down and told me I wasn’t stupid that I was showcasing learned helplessness qualities to my problems. The solutions are in front of me I just need to look for them instead of assuming I will fail.\nI had developed a mindset that I am not clever enough to work things out by myself and that I need someone to show me the way every time. As a coder that is so dangerous. It causes you to be insecure about your actions and generally worse at everything from the start. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of your own demise. If every time you want to learn something new you expect it will take you forever and you do a million tutorials or need to hire a mentor you will never get anywhere on your own.\nHe challenged me that I wasn’t as stupid as I was telling myself and that I could answer most of my questions myself. If I took more time to read the things I didn’t understand and follow all unknown paths to their end I would be able to answer any question I had. Everything was written in front of me I just needed to open my eyes and actually use my own initiative instead of depending on others.\nFor a coder, this is really hard to admit but it changed me completely.\nI’m now reading parts of applications I would just never go into before because I just assumed I wouldn’t know what was going on. And the best thing is I'm totally getting it, I’m fixing my own problems and doing things without asking questions or without even using the internet. I literally feel like a new person.\nTIPS FOR BEING AN INDEPENDENT CODER (OR THINKER)\nStuff you learn straight away and do and then forget and stop doing..:\nIf trying to do something difficult. Don’t just start coding. Write out what you are going to do. The more complicated it is the more notes you should make.\nIf you are going through someone else's code. Write down what each file does and each function within that file. methodically make a map of how things work. Write down the difficult questions and don’t stop until you have found all the answers.\nGoogle is your best friend. Everyone knows this, but how many times have you asked someone how to do something and they had to google it for you. It’s embarrassing. Before you ask someone anything, first ask google. (and depending on what you are doing, also try turning it off and on again)\n_Rubber duck philosophy _— before asking your friend (or if you don’t have a friend) but google hasn’t worked. Try the rubber duck philosophy. Have a hypothetical conversation with your rubber duck where you explain what you are doing, explain what the problem is. Maybe draw him a diagram. If you haven’t already solved the issue by just doing this you can then ask your duck the question of how to fix the problem. Then with a better map of where the problem lies break down what you do know and don’t know, this will help get to the root of the issues. You usually find that the answer is within you. So many times when explaining a problem you will say something along the lines of, ‘Well really I should just be doing x, y, z, method because this p, w, v, y, t method is a really stupid and ….’ STOP there. you’ve solved your problem.\nSo having seen the radical change this caused, I thought I would investigate ‘Learned Helplessness’ some more and it lead to this whole post.\nNote — I am a successful entrepreneur who up to now thought he was constantly challenging himself to be healthier, wealthier, happier and wiser. And for the most part, I am. buuuut there are whole sides of me I’ve stopped developing and opportunities I’ve simply shut out because of things I’ve learned about myself over time that I’ve accepted as fact.\nUp to now i’ve broken down the problems and attributes of learned helplessness which has been a little depressing and given one example of how I dealt with it but now we are going to learn about the more scientific solutions we can use how to overcome any learned helplessness attribute so we can live happier and more successful lives. Winning!\nMETHODS FOR OVERCOMING LEARNED HELPLESSNESS\n*Martin Selgman gives the example of top athletes. *\nTo become number one in a given sport you usually have to rank most consistently over a year including many events. (just think about tennis or formula 1). So to reach number one it is likely that the top athlete will also fail on several occasions. So their real strength is the ability to bounce back from a defeat and ‘hang in there’. If they just quit after a winning streak they would never be so successful. \nSeligman showed that optimists are more successful in almost all areas including relationships, sport and general health, business and academic success. So how do we become more optimistic?\nEXPLANATORY STYLES\nExplanatory styles are essentially little stories we tell ourselves to make sense of life. We are interpretation machines adn we continuosly go about our do making up explanations and stories for life around us.\nYour explanatory style is your default pattern for digesting and explaining bad events that occur. There are three main elements to each explanation, the “3P’s”, which determine if we approach problems positively or negatively.\nPersonalisation - the perception of causality\nPessimists view events as internally caused. e.g. A player loses a chess match. therefore I am bad a chess.\nAn optimist view things as externally caused and will allow for non-personal factors e.g. this opponent is amazing or today I am not feeling so good or the opponent was lucky\nPermanence - the perception of time\nPessimists believe setbacks are permanent and truly fixed forever. e.g. I will never be good at chess or be able to beat this opponent.\nOptimists believe setbacks are only temporary e.g. I didn’t prepare well or I had a cold or I need to practice more, next time I will perform better\nPervasiveness - the perception of space and further impacts\nPessimists see a setback as pervasive and related to many area’s as well as the specific setback e.g. I failed at chess, I am not clever or good at anything\nOptimist see a setback as narrowly contained in the one area of life e.g. I still have a life outside of chess where I am smart and capable.\nPERCEPTION OF GOOD AND BAD SITUATIONS\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/8fmksav\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8fmksav.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nI just explained that a pessimist views negative situations in the opposite way to an optimist, they takes them personally and as a permanent and wide reaching thing. It is also important to see how someone explains a good situation.\nWhen encountered with a good situation the self explanations swap and the pessimist views this event as external and not personal and as specific and impermanent, whereas the optimist takes a good situation as internal, longer lasting and wider reaching.\nAn individuals characteristic style of explaining events plays a major role in whether a learned helplessness trait will develop. A pessimistic explanatory style is associated with a greater likelihood of experiencing learned helplessness. \nA NICE EXAMPLE - BILL AND BEN THE FLOWERPOT MEN\nBill and Ben apply for a promotion in the flowerpot factory. They both get rejected.\nBill is a pessimist. He assumes, rightly or wrongly, that the reason he missed out is\npersonal (I wasn’t good enough), and/or\npermanent (I’ll never get ahead), and/or\npervasive (this ruins everything -what’s the point of living).\nBill is likely to give up on himself and probably won’t try again and at risk of becoming depressed due to this explanation.\nIn contrast, Ben is an optimist. Faced with the identical setback he assumes the cause is\nnon-personal (the boss’s nephew got it), and\ntemporary (I had a hangover that day), and\nnon-pervasive (this impacts my career, but not my relationship, my hobbies, my gym membership etc -life goes on).\nAs such life does go on and Ben is fine and more likely to try for other promotions and not carry the setback around with him into other area’s of his life.\nIDENTIFYING YOUR STYLE\nMartin Seligman’s site Authentic Happiness provides a free optimism assessment test to measure your level of optimistic permanence, pervasiveness and personalization. This allows you to recognize, and therefore change, your descriptions to become more optimistic.\nHOW TO ACTUALLY PREVENT LEARNED HELPLESSNESS\nMETHOD 1 - ALTERING OUR EXPLANATION STYLE\nWhen faced with loss and disappointment we should try asking ourselves these key questions to dig into current and past self explanations of problems that arise:\nPersonal\nDid you blame yourself?\nIf so, in hindsight did that prove accurate? Are you really to blame, or was it just bad luck or a factor dependant on the situation or people around you?\nPermanent\nDid you assume it would last forever?\nIf so, were those predictions accurate? How long can it really last? Will it always be like this or will it pass?\nPervasive\nDid you assume it would ruin everything in your life?\nIf so, in hindsight was that truly accurate? What does it really affect in your life? What in your life will continue unaffected?\nTry and review your explanatory style wherever possible and challenge any pessimistic explanations that have become your default setting. Review and reduce the negative impact of past setbacks and try to keep this technique to encourage more resilience in the future.\nNext time life gives you lemons don’t make lemonade. Review the Personal, Permanent and Pervasive model instead!\nMETHOD 2 - ABC METHOD\nWhen we face dissapointment or negativity of any sort we can use the ABC method to begin to change feelings of helplessness and pessimistic perspectives. The method was developed by Dr. Albert Ellis and Dr. Martin Seligman to allow a more flexible response to negativity and is a next step antidote to a defeatist mindset of learned helplessness.\nA - Adversity\nDescibe the event that happened. Leave out any evaluations or judgements. Simply describe the event that happened in a way that is as unemotional as possible.\nExample - ‘A colleague missed an important deadline and put the team behind schedule for the rest of the project'\nB - Belief\nExplain how the adveristy was interpreted. Do not state how you think it should be interpreted, but what your actual default belief or interpretation of the event was.\nExample - “I can’t believe how selfish the team member is and how unwilling they are to take things seriously. This shows their overall lack of dedication\"\nC - Consequence\nThink about the feelings and actions that result from these beliefs. Go back with a level of introspection and ask yourself how you handled it. Be sure to go deep. How and when do those emotions and feelings lead to certain behaviours and actions.\nExample - “I am overcome with anger and frustration. I feel betrayed and discouraged. I noticed I began raising my voice and becoming hostile and sharp towards the team member\"\nD - Disputation\nDo you have grounds to dispute these automatic reactions? What are the possible repercussions of following these emotions? Consider whether there are any greater benefits to moving on from the situaion and stopping this default (impulsive) reaction before it starts.\nExample - “Maybe I was overreacting. I don’t know the full situation yet. Maybe they had a bad week or tried to get the work done and ran into issues. By getting stressed I just annoy myself and others and further hinder the project by reducing our ability to work together.\"\nE - Energisation\nDid you manage to turn things around? Put all your focus on the positive feelings that ensue as a result of reframing your thoughts, emotions and behaviours. Ask yourself, what’s different between how I just handled this situation versus how I would normally handle it? Relish in those personal rewards!\nExample - “I am proud of myself for intervening in my automatic reactions and to be able to stop them part way through. I’m happy that I’m accomplishing more by looking at things in a more reasonable manner\"\nRegularly applying the ABC method will get you into the habitual groove of optimistic response and avoid damaging pessimism. When you have practiced it a few times you get to notice a natural reframing of situations in response to negative events.\n*Let’s practice it now. *\nThis ABC method has a stupid name. It is actually ABCDE and to be honest these letters were only chosen because they are catchy and they words they represent aren’t the best words to describe the action at each point! The result is I am annoyed and don’t use the method\nA - Adversity\nThere is a method that is helpful for being positive but has a silly name\nB - belief\nI think it has a really stupid name and is therefore also a stupid method\nC- Consequence\nI didn’t take it seriously because i was pre-occupied by it’s stupid name rather than the actual method\nD - Disputation\nI am being silly and wasting an opportunity to learn a better way of living my life as a calm and happier person that gets on with people better and can be more productive and kinder to those around me. I should try out the method anyway and maybe give it a better name if I am so concerned. Like ‘The deep dive method’ or… screw it actually perhaps it is a good name after all. I like the ABC method name.\nE - Energisation\nWow what a great example. I just made myself laugh at how stupid I am and feel more positive about the problem and more willing to use it to fix other things I react to negatively. Life is fabulous. and I have an example for my blog. Double win.\nMETHOD 3 - SMART GOALS\nAfter diagnosing our attribution style and learning to overcome pessimistic thinking, the final method is to understand that we are in control and take ownership of our response to situations and the next steps we take. Believing that a failure is out of our control or a situation is unlikely to change leads to worse performance.\nTo achieve greater sense of self control we should practice active goal setting. This is proven to increase behaviour change as it increases your desire to act in a particular way (motivation). setting sensible goals that are likely to be achieved provides a sense of control over our outcomes, even more so when we begin to meet those goals on a consistent basis.\nSpecific\nYou need to know exactly what you want to achieve and not some vague goal.\nQuestions:\nWhat is it exactly that I want to achieve? \nWhere is this going to happen? \nWhen am I going to make this happen? \nWho is going to be involved? \nHow am I going to make this happen? \nWhy do I want to reach this goal?\ne.g. I want to build a sustainable business with revenue\nList concrete, tangible outcomes.\nGive names, locations, offices, cities, etc.\nGive specific dates and timelines. Work backwards.\nGive names and team members as well as potential partners and others to lean on.\nWith all the information above, lay out a detailed strategy, tactic, and plan.\nTie it into your bigger vision for yourself and your business. These relate to your principles, values, missions – the things that you stay true to.\nMeasurable\nTo track your progress it must be measurable. This helps provide feedback for your brain that it is gaining a sense of self control.\nQuestions:\nMake it easy to determine where you stand with your progress\nHelp refine exactly what it is you want\ne.g. My business must hit $10k monthly recurring revenue by the end of the year\nAt this point don’t take the easy option and set small micro goals that are easy too easy to achieve.\nAchievable\nYou don’t want it to be too easy but also if it is too hard it is a pointless goal. You won’t be able to reach it and be more likely ot give up and fall back into learned helplessness traits.\nQuestions:\nIs my target really achievable?\nWhat will happen if I fall short?\nAre there any constraints or obstacles to overcome?\nWhat do I need to sacrifice to achieve it?\nRelevant\nHow relevant is the goal? Will it be fulfilling to me as an individual? Do I really want or need it or is a different goal more worthy of my effort? Does it actually fit in with your other goals\nQuestion:\nWhy is this goal important to me?\nWhat is worth sacrificing to achieve this goal?\nWill this goal really make me happier or am I just trying to prove something to others?\nTimed\nYou need a timeline ideally with sub deadlines for any goal to ensure you are on track and that it actually happens. It will help you identify neccessary steps at different points and stick to the actions required to achieve your goals. Without a timeline there is no pressure to start accomplishing the goal which allows things to slip away.\nEstablish a time frame\nSet a deadline or time for completion\nSet benchmarks\nthis will help track progress on route to goal\nhelps maintain motivation over time\nCheck in regularly\nare there steps you can be taking right now to help achieve a long term goal\nwhat should be done over the next week to contribute to the goal?\nwhat should be done over the next month to contribute to the goal?\nPracticing it\nSMART goals are great paired with something to keep you on track. There are many goal setting apps out there that do a good job. If you are really serious about a certain goal then I highly reccomend using stickK which allows you to set stakes and even take donations to antiu-charities if you don’t keep up with a certain goal.\nFINDING ANSWERS TO PROBLEMS\nThe Great Pokemon Rescue\nThe same friend who was told he was shit at english has another example where we can take ownership of our problems\nWhen he was a young child and the Pokemon craze was all the rage he finally got his first Pokemon game and had collected a few Pokemon, but after a few hours the Pokemon were getting very low on health and one had already fainted. He had missed the tutorial showing how to revive a Pokemon and he genuinely believed his Pokemon were all going to die. He sat on a wall and cried by himself. Anyone who ever played Pokemon i’m sure will feel for him and how terrible this must have felt!\nHis mother asked him what was wrong and he explained. She got out the Pokemon book she had purchased for him along with the Pokemon game, within a few minutes she found the instructions of how to revive Pokemon and joy of joys they were all saved. My friend learned that when you have a specific  problem you can research it and find solutions. This has helped him to become a great coder as he is great at reading the documentation to understand what he is taking on before he starts, and as soon as a problem arises he knows it can be fixed by research.\nUse Google Yourself\nJust like my example of coding many people are afraid of computers or coding or anything technical and become dependant on others to fix their problems. But so much of the time everything we need to know is on google. \nMyself and every developer that ever existed get so many questions from people who aren’t coders asking fairly simple things to do with computers that I don’t know how to do either. e.g. connect a printer, set up some software, connect to a network…\n All I do when asked how to fix something on this device i’ve never used before is google the problem in front of the other person and show them how to fix it. Yet when the same problem arises again or something similar they still come straight back despite being told that i don’t know how their device works and I need to use google which is a free resource they also have available.\nThis is a simple example for technical vs non technical people. but there are many other examples where we get super bogged down in fairly simple questions\nHow do I ask a girl on a date?\nHow do I study to get a higher grade in my test?\nHow do I exercise more?\nHow do I find time to meditate?\nHow do I start a business?\nThese questions basically answer themselves by just doing it and there is no real magic sauce, sure you can learn better techniques for these things\nSUMMARY\nSo we’ve found that we can all develop learned helplessness traits but with a positive attitude we can reduce our likelihood to be so prone. And by assessing ourselves we can overcome our self imposed limitations lead happier and more successful lives!\nBOOKS\nGet any of the books free on audible (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00OPA2XFG?tag=samharris48%E2%80%9321)\nLearned Helplessness: A Theory for the Age of Personal Control (amazon.co.uk/Learned-Helplessness-Theory-Personal-Control/dp/0195044673/ref=sr_1_9?crid=2FN9MD07YFN10&keywords=learned+helplessness&qid=1580448650&s=books&sprefix=learned+he%2Cstripbooks%2C348&sr=1-9)\nWritten by psychologist Christopher Peterson and the original learned helplessness researchers, Steven F.

Yet most people don&#39;t even know what it is. Sam breaks down what the effect is, from how it was discovered to what you can do about it.</p>\n\n<p>This episode helps us learn more traits to boost our growth mindset with the goal of making you a more positive and strategic thinker able to look at the bigger picture and less caught up in the problems life throws at us.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>\n\n<p>It was discovered by Marting Seligman. He restrained dogs in a box  and then gave them an electric shock at the same time as ringing a bell. After repeating this the dogs learned they would get a shock every time they heard the bell.</p>\n\n<p>He then put them in a box with a small fence they could jump over. on the other side of the fence would not get a shock when the bell rang. However, when the bell rang they just cowered and accepted the shock.</p>\n\n<p>If he put a different dog in the box that had not received the electric shocks before it would try to escape and quickly learn that when the bell rang it would be safe on one side of the box and not on the other.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/9n8EWi6\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9n8EWi6.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>This has been demonstrated with other animal studies such as rats and even elephants and just in teh last few years in zebrafish and tree-shrews. </p>\n\n<p>They found that elelphant trainers would tie a young elephant to a post and it would struggle to try and escape the rope. For hours and days they might pull against it before giving up. However, once they gave up they wouldn’t test it again. So once teh elephant becomes an adult that can rip up tree’s and knock down walls, if you tie it to the post it was tied to as a child it gives up and sits down until it’s released. amazing!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>LEARNED HELPLESSNESS IN HUMANS</h3>\n\n<p>Learned helplessness in extreme scenarios has not been experimented on with humans but it has been proven to be similar to those observed in animals although there are more complicated factors at hand and they found two types of helplessness can arise.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Original Experiment</strong></p>\n\n<p>In one experiment they had three cases for the human test subjects.</p>\n\n<p>One group heard a loud noise and had a button in front of them. they needed to press the button 4 times to make it stop and they usually worked this out pretty fast.</p>\n\n<p>a second group had the same noise and hte same button. but when pressed the button did nothing and the subjects soon stopped bothering with the pointless button</p>\n\n<p>a third group had no noise at all.</p>\n\n<p>In the second test all participants heard a similar loud noise and had a box with a lever in front of them. When manipulated the lever turned off the noise.</p>\n\n<p>Groups 1 and 3 learned to turn off the noise quickly. group 2 who had become used to not being ablt to turn off the noise mostly didn’t try the lever and sat with an annoying noise playing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Deficits of Helplessness</strong></p>\n\n<p>They deduced that learned helplessness creates three deficits in subjects, cognitive, motivational and emotional:</p>\n\n<p>Cognitive - the subject has the idea in their mind that their circumstances are uncontrollable</p>\n\n<p>Motivational - meaning that the subject doesn’t bother to respond to potential methods of escaping a negative situation</p>\n\n<p>Emotional - the subject takes on a depressed state when they are placed in a negative situation they cannot control</p>\n\n<p><strong>TWO TYPES OF HELPLESSNESS</strong><br>\nLearned helplessness in humans can have two types. Universal helplessness and personal helplessness</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Universal helplessness</em></strong> is a sense of helplessness where the subject believes nothing can be done about the situation, no one can help alleviate the pain or discomfort.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Personal helplessness</em></strong> is where the person believes that others may be able to find a solution or to avoid the pain or discomfort but that they are not personally capable of finding a solution.</p>\n\n<p>Both can lead to a state of depression but with different qualities.</p>\n\n<p><em>Universal helplessness</em> leads to explanation of the problem being due to external factors that they can’t solve, whereas personal helplessness will tend to be explained due to internal reasons.</p>\n\n<p>As such <em>personal helplessness</em> is associated with a lower sense of self-esteem and can have a greater emotional impact.</p>\n\n<p>Neither are great and experiencing either is a bad place to be. They are more likely to arise when we are anxious or under stress and then just naturally over-time we are more likely to accumulate learned helplessness traits as we get older due to two fundamental laws of nature</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>as time passes we are exposed to more situations where learned helplessness can arise</p></li>\n<li><p>as time passes our bodies age and we experience more loss of abilities and health complications, some of which are reversible yet they get accepted.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As well as the immediate issues of not helping ourselves in the given situation it also has negative effects such as burnout, Depression, anxiety, phobias, shyness, and loneliness</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>COMMON LEARNED HELPLESSNESS EXAMPLES</h3>\n\n<p><strong>CHILDREN IN SCHOOL</strong><br>\nOften a child performs badly in one topic, math or in my case languages. They perform poorly compared to the rest of the class and the teacher doesn’t provide useful examples the student can learn from or faith in the student that they can do better. The student gets used to being bad at the subject and only get’s worse and pays less attention in lessons and completes homework in a more resigned manner expecting to do badly. They lose confidence to use the skills in the rest of their live. i.e. a bad math student never has confidence to work with figures or a bad language student never tries to learn a new language and assumes they will not be able to.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Example</strong></p>\n\n<p>My friend who first told me about learned helplessness used to be bad at english, when he was a t school in Germany he had one teacher who gave him his test results back once and told him he’d never be any good at english and that he was a stupid child. like seriously WTF was this guy being a teacher but the effect was really damaging on my friends motivation to even try and get better at english so he always approached it with an attitude that he wouldn’t learn much and struggled even more than he needed to. Luckily Germans basically have to study english forever so he went on to become pretty much fluent, however, he still had really low confidence for a long time even when he was pretty much fluent until he found out about learned helplessness and how silly his mindset was.</p>\n\n<p><strong>SHYNESS</strong><br>\nAnother common example is shyness. People who feel shy in social situations can eventually feel there is nothing they can do to overcome their symptoms. When the believe their symptoms our outside of their control this can lead to them not engaging in social situations and making the shyness even more pronounced and compounding effects of anxiety and stress around the situation so they avoid it even more.</p>\n\n<p>I personally have suffered from shyness and language learning difficulties. but where i first encountered learned helplessness was with coding</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>MY FIRST HELPLESSNESS QUALITY - CODING</h4>\n\n<p>I realised my first ‘learned helplessness’ quality whilst my co-founder was teaching me some programming techniques for a new front end framework we we  re writing. I am more the business guy that has just got into coding and not exactly the core developer here but I can code. However, as he was teaching me and giving me tasks to do I was constantly asking more questions whenever I became stuck or didn’t understand something. I didn’t have a lot of confidence in the code I was writing and generally made the assumption that what I was doing was probably wrong. I’d literally internalised that I was a bit of an idiot. He sat down and told me I wasn’t stupid that I was showcasing learned helplessness qualities to my problems. The solutions are in front of me I just need to look for them instead of assuming I will fail.</p>\n\n<p>I had developed a mindset that I am not clever enough to work things out by myself and that I need someone to show me the way every time. As a coder that is so dangerous. It causes you to be insecure about your actions and generally worse at everything from the start. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of your own demise. If every time you want to learn something new you expect it will take you forever and you do a million tutorials or need to hire a mentor you will never get anywhere on your own.</p>\n\n<p>He challenged me that I wasn’t as stupid as I was telling myself and that I could answer most of my questions myself. If I took more time to read the things I didn’t understand and follow all unknown paths to their end I would be able to answer any question I had. Everything was written in front of me I just needed to open my eyes and actually use my own initiative instead of depending on others.</p>\n\n<p>For a coder, this is really hard to admit but it changed me completely.</p>\n\n<p>I’m now reading parts of applications I would just never go into before because I just assumed I wouldn’t know what was going on. And the best thing is I&#39;m totally getting it, I’m fixing my own problems and doing things without asking questions or without even using the internet. I literally feel like a new person.</p>\n\n<h4>TIPS FOR BEING AN INDEPENDENT CODER (OR THINKER)</h4>\n\n<p>Stuff you learn straight away and do and then forget and stop doing..:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>If trying to do something difficult. Don’t just start coding. Write out what you are going to do. The more complicated it is the more notes you should make.</p></li>\n<li><p>If you are going through someone else&#39;s code. Write down what each file does and each function within that file. methodically make a map of how things work. Write down the difficult questions and don’t stop until you have found all the answers.</p></li>\n<li><p>Google is your best friend. Everyone knows this, but how many times have you asked someone how to do something and they had to google it for you. It’s embarrassing. Before you ask someone anything, first ask google. (and depending on what you are doing, also try turning it off and on again)</p></li>\n<li><p>_Rubber duck philosophy _— before asking your friend (or if you don’t have a friend) but google hasn’t worked. Try the rubber duck philosophy. Have a hypothetical conversation with your rubber duck where you explain what you are doing, explain what the problem is. Maybe draw him a diagram. If you haven’t already solved the issue by just doing this you can then ask your duck the question of how to fix the problem. Then with a better map of where the problem lies break down what you do know and don’t know, this will help get to the root of the issues. You usually find that the answer is within you. So many times when explaining a problem you will say something along the lines of, ‘Well really I should just be doing x, y, z, method because this p, w, v, y, t method is a really stupid and ….’ STOP there. you’ve solved your problem.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So having seen the radical change this caused, I thought I would investigate ‘Learned Helplessness’ some more and it lead to this whole post.</p>\n\n<p>Note — I am a successful entrepreneur who up to now thought he was constantly challenging himself to be healthier, wealthier, happier and wiser. And for the most part, I am. buuuut there are whole sides of me I’ve stopped developing and opportunities I’ve simply shut out because of things I’ve learned about myself over time that I’ve accepted as fact.</p>\n\n<p>Up to now i’ve broken down the problems and attributes of learned helplessness which has been a little depressing and given one example of how I dealt with it but now we are going to learn about the more scientific solutions we can use how to overcome any learned helplessness attribute so we can live happier and more successful lives. Winning!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>METHODS FOR OVERCOMING LEARNED HELPLESSNESS</h3>\n\n<p>*<em>Martin Selgman gives the example of top athletes. *</em></p>\n\n<p>To become number one in a given sport you usually have to rank most consistently over a year including many events. (just think about tennis or formula 1). So to reach number one it is likely that the top athlete will also fail on several occasions. So their real strength is the ability to bounce back from a defeat and ‘hang in there’. If they just quit after a winning streak they would never be so successful. </p>\n\n<p>Seligman showed that optimists are more successful in almost all areas including relationships, sport and general health, business and academic success. So how do we become more optimistic?</p>\n\n<p><strong>EXPLANATORY STYLES</strong><br>\nExplanatory styles are essentially little stories we tell ourselves to make sense of life. We are interpretation machines adn we continuosly go about our do making up explanations and stories for life around us.</p>\n\n<p>Your explanatory style is your default pattern for digesting and explaining bad events that occur. There are three main elements to each explanation, the “3P’s”, which determine if we approach problems positively or negatively.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Personalisation</strong> - the perception of causality</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Pessimists view events as internally caused. e.g. A player loses a chess match. therefore I am bad a chess.</p>\n\n<p>An optimist view things as externally caused and will allow for non-personal factors e.g. this opponent is amazing or today I am not feeling so good or the opponent was lucky</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Permanence</strong> - the perception of time</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Pessimists believe setbacks are permanent and truly fixed forever. e.g. I will never be good at chess or be able to beat this opponent.</p>\n\n<p>Optimists believe setbacks are only temporary e.g. I didn’t prepare well or I had a cold or I need to practice more, next time I will perform better</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pervasiveness</strong> - the perception of space and further impacts</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Pessimists see a setback as pervasive and related to many area’s as well as the specific setback e.g. I failed at chess, I am not clever or good at anything</p>\n\n<p>Optimist see a setback as narrowly contained in the one area of life e.g. I still have a life outside of chess where I am smart and capable.</p>\n\n<h5>PERCEPTION OF GOOD AND BAD SITUATIONS</h5>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/8fmksav\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8fmksav.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I just explained that a pessimist views negative situations in the opposite way to an optimist, they takes them personally and as a permanent and wide reaching thing. It is also important to see how someone explains a good situation.</p>\n\n<p>When encountered with a good situation the self explanations swap and the pessimist views this event as external and not personal and as specific and impermanent, whereas the optimist takes a good situation as internal, longer lasting and wider reaching.</p>\n\n<p>An individuals characteristic style of explaining events plays a major role in whether a learned helplessness trait will develop. A pessimistic explanatory style is associated with a greater likelihood of experiencing learned helplessness. </p>\n\n<h5>A NICE EXAMPLE - BILL AND BEN THE FLOWERPOT MEN</h5>\n\n<p>Bill and Ben apply for a promotion in the flowerpot factory. They both get rejected.</p>\n\n<p>Bill is a pessimist. He assumes, rightly or wrongly, that the reason he missed out is</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>personal</em> (I wasn’t good enough), and/or</p></li>\n<li><p><em>permanent</em> (I’ll never get ahead), and/or</p></li>\n<li><p><em>pervasive</em> (this ruins everything -what’s the point of living).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Bill is likely to give up on himself and probably won’t try again and at risk of becoming depressed due to this explanation.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, Ben is an optimist. Faced with the identical setback he assumes the cause is</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>non-personal</em> (the boss’s nephew got it), and</p></li>\n<li><p><em>temporary</em> (I had a hangover that day), and</p></li>\n<li><p><em>non-pervasive</em> (this impacts my career, but not my relationship, my hobbies, my gym membership etc -life goes on).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As such life does go on and Ben is fine and more likely to try for other promotions and not carry the setback around with him into other area’s of his life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>IDENTIFYING YOUR STYLE</strong><br>\nMartin Seligman’s site Authentic Happiness provides a free optimism assessment test to measure your level of optimistic permanence, pervasiveness and personalization. This allows you to recognize, and therefore change, your descriptions to become more optimistic.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>HOW TO ACTUALLY PREVENT LEARNED HELPLESSNESS</h3>\n\n<h4>METHOD 1 - ALTERING OUR EXPLANATION STYLE</h4>\n\n<p>When faced with loss and disappointment we should try asking ourselves these key questions to dig into current and past self explanations of problems that arise:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Personal</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Did you blame yourself?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If so, in hindsight did that prove accurate? Are you really to blame, or was it just bad luck or a factor dependant on the situation or people around you?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Permanent</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Did you assume it would last forever?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If so, were those predictions accurate? How long can it really last? Will it always be like this or will it pass?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pervasive</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Did you assume it would ruin everything in your life?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If so, in hindsight was that truly accurate? What does it really affect in your life? What in your life will continue unaffected?</p>\n\n<p>Try and review your explanatory style wherever possible and challenge any pessimistic explanations that have become your default setting. Review and reduce the negative impact of past setbacks and try to keep this technique to encourage more resilience in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Next time life gives you lemons don’t make lemonade. Review the Personal, Permanent and Pervasive model instead!</p>\n\n<h4>METHOD 2 - ABC METHOD</h4>\n\n<p>When we face dissapointment or negativity of any sort we can use the ABC method to begin to change feelings of helplessness and pessimistic perspectives. The method was developed by Dr. Albert Ellis and Dr. Martin Seligman to allow a more flexible response to negativity and is a next step antidote to a defeatist mindset of learned helplessness.</p>\n\n<p>A - Adversity</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Descibe the event that happened. Leave out any evaluations or judgements. Simply describe the event that happened in a way that is as unemotional as possible.</p></li>\n<li><p>Example - ‘A colleague missed an important deadline and put the team behind schedule for the rest of the project&#39;</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>B - Belief</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Explain how the adveristy was interpreted. Do not state how you think it should be interpreted, but what your actual default belief or interpretation of the event was.</p></li>\n<li><p>Example - “I can’t believe how selfish the team member is and how unwilling they are to take things seriously. This shows their overall lack of dedication&quot;</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>C - Consequence</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Think about the feelings and actions that result from these beliefs. Go back with a level of introspection and ask yourself how you handled it. Be sure to go deep. How and when do those emotions and feelings lead to certain behaviours and actions.</p></li>\n<li><p>Example - “I am overcome with anger and frustration. I feel betrayed and discouraged. I noticed I began raising my voice and becoming hostile and sharp towards the team member&quot;</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>D - Disputation</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Do you have grounds to dispute these automatic reactions? What are the possible repercussions of following these emotions? Consider whether there are any greater benefits to moving on from the situaion and stopping this default (impulsive) reaction before it starts.</p></li>\n<li><p>Example - “Maybe I was overreacting. I don’t know the full situation yet. Maybe they had a bad week or tried to get the work done and ran into issues. By getting stressed I just annoy myself and others and further hinder the project by reducing our ability to work together.&quot;</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>E - Energisation</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Did you manage to turn things around? Put all your focus on the positive feelings that ensue as a result of reframing your thoughts, emotions and behaviours. Ask yourself, what’s different between how I just handled this situation versus how I would normally handle it? Relish in those personal rewards!</p></li>\n<li><p>Example - “I am proud of myself for intervening in my automatic reactions and to be able to stop them part way through. I’m happy that I’m accomplishing more by looking at things in a more reasonable manner&quot;</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Regularly applying the ABC method will get you into the habitual groove of optimistic response and avoid damaging pessimism. When you have practiced it a few times you get to notice a natural reframing of situations in response to negative events.</p>\n\n<p>*<em>Let’s practice it now. *</em></p>\n\n<p>This ABC method has a stupid name. It is actually ABCDE and to be honest these letters were only chosen because they are catchy and they words they represent aren’t the best words to describe the action at each point! The result is I am annoyed and don’t use the method</p>\n\n<p>A - Adversity</p>\n\n<p>There is a method that is helpful for being positive but has a silly name</p>\n\n<p>B - belief</p>\n\n<p>I think it has a really stupid name and is therefore also a stupid method</p>\n\n<p>C- Consequence</p>\n\n<p>I didn’t take it seriously because i was pre-occupied by it’s stupid name rather than the actual method</p>\n\n<p>D - Disputation</p>\n\n<p>I am being silly and wasting an opportunity to learn a better way of living my life as a calm and happier person that gets on with people better and can be more productive and kinder to those around me. I should try out the method anyway and maybe give it a better name if I am so concerned. Like ‘The deep dive method’ or… screw it actually perhaps it is a good name after all. I like the ABC method name.</p>\n\n<p>E - Energisation</p>\n\n<p>Wow what a great example. I just made myself laugh at how stupid I am and feel more positive about the problem and more willing to use it to fix other things I react to negatively. Life is fabulous. and I have an example for my blog. Double win.</p>\n\n<h4>METHOD 3 - SMART GOALS</h4>\n\n<p>After diagnosing our attribution style and learning to overcome pessimistic thinking, the final method is to understand that we are in control and take ownership of our response to situations and the next steps we take. Believing that a failure is out of our control or a situation is unlikely to change leads to worse performance.</p>\n\n<p>To achieve greater sense of self control we should practice active goal setting. This is proven to increase behaviour change as it increases your desire to act in a particular way (motivation). setting sensible goals that are likely to be achieved provides a sense of control over our outcomes, even more so when we begin to meet those goals on a consistent basis.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Specific</strong></p>\n\n<p>You need to know exactly what you want to achieve and not some vague goal.</p>\n\n<p>Questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>What is it exactly that I want to achieve? </p></li>\n<li><p>Where is this going to happen? </p></li>\n<li><p>When am I going to make this happen? </p></li>\n<li><p>Who is going to be involved? </p></li>\n<li><p>How am I going to make this happen? </p></li>\n<li><p>Why do I want to reach this goal?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>e.g. I want to build a sustainable business with revenue</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>List concrete, tangible outcomes.</p></li>\n<li><p>Give names, locations, offices, cities, etc.</p></li>\n<li><p>Give specific dates and timelines. Work backwards.</p></li>\n<li><p>Give names and team members as well as potential partners and others to lean on.</p></li>\n<li><p>With all the information above, lay out a detailed strategy, tactic, and plan.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tie it into your bigger vision for yourself and your business. These relate to your principles, values, missions – the things that you stay true to.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Measurable</strong></p>\n\n<p>To track your progress it must be measurable. This helps provide feedback for your brain that it is gaining a sense of self control.</p>\n\n<p>Questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Make it easy to determine where you stand with your progress</p></li>\n<li><p>Help refine exactly what it is you want</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>e.g. My business must hit $10k monthly recurring revenue by the end of the year</p>\n\n<p>At this point don’t take the easy option and set small micro goals that are easy too easy to achieve.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Achievable</strong></p>\n\n<p>You don’t want it to be too easy but also if it is too hard it is a pointless goal. You won’t be able to reach it and be more likely ot give up and fall back into learned helplessness traits.</p>\n\n<p>Questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Is my target really achievable?</p></li>\n<li><p>What will happen if I fall short?</p></li>\n<li><p>Are there any constraints or obstacles to overcome?</p></li>\n<li><p>What do I need to sacrifice to achieve it?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Relevant</strong></p>\n\n<p>How relevant is the goal? Will it be fulfilling to me as an individual? Do I really want or need it or is a different goal more worthy of my effort? Does it actually fit in with your other goals</p>\n\n<p>Question:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Why is this goal important to me?</p></li>\n<li><p>What is worth sacrificing to achieve this goal?</p></li>\n<li><p>Will this goal really make me happier or am I just trying to prove something to others?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Timed</strong></p>\n\n<p>You need a timeline ideally with sub deadlines for any goal to ensure you are on track and that it actually happens. It will help you identify neccessary steps at different points and stick to the actions required to achieve your goals. Without a timeline there is no pressure to start accomplishing the goal which allows things to slip away.</p>\n\n<p>Establish a time frame</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Set a deadline or time for completion</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Set benchmarks</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>this will help track progress on route to goal</p></li>\n<li><p>helps maintain motivation over time</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Check in regularly</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>are there steps you can be taking right now to help achieve a long term goal</p></li>\n<li><p>what should be done over the next week to contribute to the goal?</p></li>\n<li><p>what should be done over the next month to contribute to the goal?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Practicing it</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>SMART</em> goals are great paired with something to keep you on track. There are many goal setting apps out there that do a good job. If you are really serious about a certain goal then I highly reccomend using stickK which allows you to set stakes and even take donations to antiu-charities if you don’t keep up with a certain goal.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>FINDING ANSWERS TO PROBLEMS</h3>\n\n<p><strong>The Great Pokemon Rescue</strong></p>\n\n<p>The same friend who was told he was shit at english has another example where we can take ownership of our problems</p>\n\n<p>When he was a young child and the Pokemon craze was all the rage he finally got his first Pokemon game and had collected a few Pokemon, but after a few hours the Pokemon were getting very low on health and one had already fainted. He had missed the tutorial showing how to revive a Pokemon and he genuinely believed his Pokemon were all going to die. He sat on a wall and cried by himself. Anyone who ever played Pokemon i’m sure will feel for him and how terrible this must have felt!</p>\n\n<p>His mother asked him what was wrong and he explained. She got out the Pokemon book she had purchased for him along with the Pokemon game, within a few minutes she found the instructions of how to revive Pokemon and joy of joys they were all saved. My friend learned that when you have a specific  problem you can research it and find solutions. This has helped him to become a great coder as he is great at reading the documentation to understand what he is taking on before he starts, and as soon as a problem arises he knows it can be fixed by research.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Use Google Yourself</strong></p>\n\n<p>Just like my example of coding many people are afraid of computers or coding or anything technical and become dependant on others to fix their problems. But so much of the time everything we need to know is on google. </p>\n\n<p>Myself and every developer that ever existed get so many questions from people who aren’t coders asking fairly simple things to do with computers that I don’t know how to do either. e.g. connect a printer, set up some software, connect to a network…</p>\n\n<p>All I do when asked how to fix something on this device i’ve never used before is google the problem in front of the other person and show them how to fix it. Yet when the same problem arises again or something similar they still come straight back despite being told that i don’t know how their device works and I need to use google which is a free resource they also have available.</p>\n\n<p>This is a simple example for technical vs non technical people. but there are many other examples where we get super bogged down in fairly simple questions</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>How do I ask a girl on a date?</p></li>\n<li><p>How do I study to get a higher grade in my test?</p></li>\n<li><p>How do I exercise more?</p></li>\n<li><p>How do I find time to meditate?</p></li>\n<li><p>How do I start a business?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These questions basically answer themselves by just doing it and there is no real magic sauce, sure you can learn better techniques for these things</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>SUMMARY</h4>\n\n<p>So we’ve found that we can all develop learned helplessness traits but with a positive attitude we can reduce our likelihood to be so prone. And by assessing ourselves we can overcome our self imposed limitations lead happier and more successful lives!</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h4>BOOKS</h4>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00OPA2XFG?tag=samharris48%E2%80%9321\" rel=\"nofollow\">Get any of the books free on audible</a></p>\n\n<p>[<strong>Learned Helplessness: A Theory for the Age of Personal Control</strong>](amazon.co.uk/Learned-Helplessness-Theory-Personal-Control/dp/0195044673/ref=sr_1_9?crid=2FN9MD07YFN10&amp;keywords=learned+helplessness&amp;qid=1580448650&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=learned+he%2Cstripbooks%2C348&amp;sr=1-9)<br>\nWritten by psychologist Christopher Peterson and the original learned helplessness researchers, Steven F.

When you think of things from other peoples perspectives instead from your own perspective you really unlock a whole extra dimension of happiness that never even existed before and its suddenly becomes remarkably easy to enjoy each day instead of going through life selfishly trying to have more for yourself or feeling owed stuff or victimised when you don’t get as much as others instead of feeling happy that other people are doing well. \nThis also makes you are much nicer person to be around and then other people start doing nice things for you and your life and relationships get a whole lot better.\nBob thinks that the ability to be generous should be considered a privilege that you shouldn’t take for granted and should use at all times:\n1 - The fact you can give anything is a privilege. even just a smile is a privilege that you are happy. giving anything of value is a privilege that you have something of value.\n2 - Being able to give to others because they are open to receive is also a privilege. Not everyone in life is ready to receive help or advice or any form of gifts from you. So when people are open to generosity you can be grateful that you are able to improve their day.\nThen to conclude with his biggest philosophy - Having what you need is enough and having more is awesome because you get to give to others.\n <a href=\"https://imgur.com/sJcBgA9\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sJcBgA9.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nHAPPINESS THROUGH LIVING IN THE MOMENT AND JUST DECIDING TO BE HAPPY\nDon’t let your expectations of what you want control your happiness. when shit things happen accept them and just move on without being dragged into unhappiness, like Bob and his new kitchen or me and my parking ticket. If you accept reality as it is straight away you can continue to be happy and have good relationships with the people around you. If you kick and scream like a child resisting acceptance of this new fate that has befallen you and blaming those around or shouting at people you are just being stupid, you have to accept this new situation you are in eventually and you are just wasting time.\nIf a problem arises and you let that make you unhappy and get angry or sad, instead of having one problem you create many more problems for yourself and waste your own time being unhappy about life and waste time of others being a dick and life is simply too short too waste with this so just don’t. and then life is much better.\nAnd as a bonus when you observe the fact that you could be unhappy right now but have decided not to be, you feel even happier because you aware of how much crap you are avoiding.  \nI appreciate that this is super easy to say and super hard to do. Like i learnt my lesson with the parking ticket ten years ago but still didn’t become great at practicing it till more recently. Some people certainly feel like they are supposed to get angry when someone does them wrong and like it’s violating their principles letting someone get away with something. but if you can look at the big picture and see how much benefit and negative you truly get from following these negative emotions it just always works out worst for yourself. Like buddhist say. ‘Holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other man to get sick'\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/9zbVbnj\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9zbVbnj.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nSTAY TRUE TO YOUR BELIEFS\nWhen something makes you feel awkward and you know it's wrong yet you feel like it can’t be changed and those around you aren’t doing anything. Don’t just carry on. Have the balls to stick your neck out and risk it. Bob saved patients money and impressed his bosses by being the one willing to tell them about the issues going on with doctors stealing money from patients. He risked being not understood or losing sales of the product for his company by doctors no longer using their products. But he stood up for his belief and the patients and everything worked out.\nI think we all have times when our morale beliefs are challenged and examples like this are a great reason to have faith in ourselves instead of just following the crowd.\nBOOKS\nGet any of the books free on audible (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00OPA2XFG?tag=samharris48%E2%80%9321)\nREPLAY - KEN GRIMWOOD (https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=replay+ken+grimwood&i=stripbooks&crid=34URPC1UQLI34&sprefix=replay+%2Cstripbooks%2C361&ref=nb_sb_ss_i_1_7)\nThe tale of a man who is reborn several times into his same body as a teenager and provides a great perspective on the way someone can choose to live a life.

Putting yourself out there in a sink or swim situation is the best way to learn fast and hard. Sherman was terrified of sales but running out of money he finally actually charged for his products and learnt how to sell them</p>\n\n<h4>2.DON&#39;T DO EVERYTHING YOURSELF</h4>\n\n<p>&#39;Someone else is always better than you at something&#39; - Don&#39;t try and take everything on yourself because you aren&#39;t even the best person to do everything. People can help your idea or teach you much faster than if you do everything by yourself.</p>\n\n<h4>3. MUMS ARE AWESOME</h4>\n\n<p>Mums put in a lot of effort.

It seems to be considered one of the Great french classics that is taught in school but much more appreciated as an adult and I really can’t wait to read it. It seems to be a coming of age novel about a french man who moves to Paris to seek love and glory and i’m hoping to get insights on life and France all in a beautiful novel. \nMEMOIRS: A TWENTIETH CENTURY JOURNEY IN SCIENCE AND POLITICS - EDWARD TELLER AUTOBIOGRAPHY (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Memoirs-Twentieth-century-Journey-Politics-2001-11-26/dp/B01K0TNNJK/ref=sr_1_1?crid=22NC5EPOCPVK7&keywords=edward+teller&qid=1580443005&s=books&sprefix=edward+te%2Cstripbooks%2C456&sr=1-1)\nIt covers the story behind the H-bomb as well as The entire path of edward teller leading up to and after it.

Running a business and not giving u on his personal hobbies. I don’t think i’ll ever forget the story of Antoine playing chess with him, that is truly incredible.</p>\n\n<h4>CHALLENGE YOURSELF AND DON&#39;T BE AFRAID TO TAKE A PAY CUT</h4>\n\n<p>Open yourself to interesting challenges and learning experiences at every point. America vs. Japan —&gt; choose japan. Taking the next job up the chain vs a step down in a new avenue where you can learn loads more.</p>\n\n<h4>ASK CANDIDATES WHAT OTHERS THINK OF THEM</h4>\n\n<p>You can get a lot more insight into how a person actually functions by asking what others think of them rather than just asking for their strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h5>BOOKS</h5>\n\n<p>A huge fan of history and reading real books. I would love a chance to look into his personal library. but for now we have these books from him as his must reads.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00OPA2XFG?tag=samharris48%E2%80%9321\" rel=\"nofollow\">Get any of the books free on audible</a></p>\n\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lost-Illusions-Classics-Honore-Balzac/dp/0140442510/ref=sr_1_5?crid=29T01OXRDFX70&keywords=honore+de+balzac&qid=1580442932&s=books&sprefix=honore%2Caudible%2C375&sr=1-5\" rel=\"nofollow\">LOST ILLUSIONS (LA COMÉDIE HUMAINE #38) -  HONORÉ DE BALZAC</a></h4>\n\n<p>I’d never heard of this book but on investigation it sounds amazing. It seems to be considered one of the Great french classics that is taught in school but much more appreciated as an adult and I really can’t wait to read it. It seems to be a coming of age novel about a french man who moves to Paris to seek love and glory and i’m hoping to get insights on life and France all in a beautiful novel. </p>\n\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Memoirs-Twentieth-century-Journey-Politics-2001-11-26/dp/B01K0TNNJK/ref=sr_1_1?crid=22NC5EPOCPVK7&keywords=edward+teller&qid=1580443005&s=books&sprefix=edward+te%2Cstripbooks%2C456&sr=1-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">MEMOIRS: A TWENTIETH CENTURY JOURNEY IN SCIENCE AND POLITICS - EDWARD TELLER AUTOBIOGRAPHY</a></h4>\n\n<p>It covers the story behind the H-bomb as well as The entire path of edward teller leading up to and after it.

He has an uncanny ability to break things down and gamify self-improvement as well as pretty much anything else.\nI worked with him co-running Basecamp, a business accelerator for students at Bristol University where we learnt a lot about start-ups and young entrepreneurs.\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/Gop2AOY\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Gop2AOY.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nOn the show, we cover a lot about start-ups... Also, lots of business ideas and strategies for self-improvement and fun times travelling. He has a great view of the world that I think you’ll enjoy.\nTOP TIPS\n1. Gamify Self-improvement\nI love the way he breaks things down and works out how to improve them, t’s good to always step back and be mindful and curious about what you’re doing and what you want to achieve.\nWherever possible try and make the process more fun by gamifying elements of it or setting targets, rewards or budgets that you can monitor and acknowledge achievements.\nNote — Learn to Type Fast!\n2. Cycle Touring is Awesome\nI need to do more cycle touring with my life, everyone should try it. It’s such a great way to see the world. It can be done really cheaply and is a fun healthy way of exploring with a good amount of challenge.\n3. Work with people who complement you\nJust because you and a potential partner are both interested in an idea and get along, doesn’t mean you are the best business partners. You need to find someone that seeks out and solves the problem that you can’t, otherwise you are just double working and can actually cause conflict.\nPeople that do the same job as you should just be the employee’s that you hire whilst you find new problems that you can solve. People that solve things you can’t comprehend are your partners.\nBOOKS\nPeak By Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool (https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0099598477/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=samharris48-21&camp=1634&creative=6738&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0099598477&linkId=1c98598c611f126099f511453d9fc429)\nThis book really embodies the growth mindset and explains how you can improve and master and any skill. You don’t necessarily need innate talent to be brilliant. \nHave you ever wanted to learn a language or pick up an instrument, only to become too daunted by the task at hand? Expert performance guru Anders Ericsson has made a career studying chess champions, violin virtuosos, star athletes, and memory mavens. Peak condenses three decades of original research to introduce an incredibly powerful approach to learning that is fundamentally different from the way people traditionally think about acquiring a skill.\nTim Ferris 4 Hour Work Week (https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0091929113/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=samharris48-21&camp=1634&creative=6738&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0091929113&linkId=aedd06f7c832dcf330de702072716460)\nGreat book on how to live your life and be more successful.

Gamify Self-improvement</h4>\n\n<p>I love the way he breaks things down and works out how to improve them, t’s good to always step back and be mindful and curious about what you’re doing and what you want to achieve.</p>\n\n<p>Wherever possible try and make the process more fun by gamifying elements of it or setting targets, rewards or budgets that you can monitor and acknowledge achievements.</p>\n\n<p>Note — Learn to Type Fast!</p>\n\n<h4>2. Cycle Touring is Awesome</h4>\n\n<p>I need to do more cycle touring with my life, everyone should try it. It’s such a great way to see the world. It can be done really cheaply and is a fun healthy way of exploring with a good amount of challenge.</p>\n\n<h4>3. Work with people who complement you</h4>\n\n<p>Just because you and a potential partner are both interested in an idea and get along, doesn’t mean you are the best business partners. You need to find someone that seeks out and solves the problem that you can’t, otherwise you are just double working and can actually cause conflict.</p>\n\n<p>People that do the same job as you should just be the employee’s that you hire whilst you find new problems that you can solve. People that solve things you can’t comprehend are your partners.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>BOOKS</h3>\n\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0099598477/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=samharris48-21&camp=1634&creative=6738&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0099598477&linkId=1c98598c611f126099f511453d9fc429\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peak By Anders Ericsson and Robert Pool</a></h4>\n\n<p>This book really embodies the growth mindset and explains how you can improve and master and any skill.

Expert performance guru Anders Ericsson has made a career studying chess champions, violin virtuosos, star athletes, and memory mavens. Peak condenses three decades of original research to introduce an incredibly powerful approach to learning that is fundamentally different from the way people traditionally think about acquiring a skill.</p>\n\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0091929113/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=samharris48-21&camp=1634&creative=6738&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0091929113&linkId=aedd06f7c832dcf330de702072716460\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tim Ferris 4 Hour Work Week</a></h4>\n\n<p>Great book on how to live your life and be more successful.

If you haven't listened to the first episodes with Theo start there.\nAdditionally, I share some of my best insights from the podcast this year as well as my 2 satoshi on Bitcoin and being a strategic investor.\nTOP TIPS\n1. SUCCESS = EXECUTION, PERSISTENCE AND JUST TAKING IT SERIOUSLY\nThere have been a number of idea’s that really could have been a success if we’d put more effort into the execution and persisted with the idea. Often the success of a project is directly relational to how seriously you take it. Putting time and money into it is often the only way to really ignite a business. Once things are going and you have a customer the next steps can seem to happen but crossing the chasm from a hobby side-project to a fully fledged business is a big step you have to commit to by taking a big breath and taking the plunge.\n2. PRACTICE MINIMALISM\nA million to-dos in your day are confusing and lead to decision fatigue and generally poor execution. Having less is really more in all aspects of life. Practicing minimalism in everything is liberating and allows you to be much more successful. Whether it is stuff you have stored at home or the amount of packing you have. to the number of idea’s, you work on at once.\nNow that I’m living a more minimal life I really find it mental the amount of stuff that people have they don’t use, yet they let it take up their time and money just keeping hold of these things they don’t need. A great new years thing to do is a big clear-out of your possessions. Analyse your main projects and prioritising which ones you want to achieve first and focus on just that. Give your brain the freedom to be awesome at something without distraction\n3. BE REALISTIC ABOUT EXPECTATIONS\nFor your own sanity and for the benefit of others you can really help yourself by being realistic about what you expect to achieve. Being ambitious is essential, but if it leads to you overpromising on things you will end up working far too hard on things that you under-deliver on. People will perceive you as a failure and often incapable, you will lose motivation yourself and end up with too many things on your plate which as discussed earlier is not what you want.\nAllowing longer timelines for things means you can do them properly with focus. People you work with whether a customer or a boss will know when they are getting the thing and you can expect it to be of correct quality. You can execute stress-free and have some time for yourself to chill rather than running around like a stressed out headless idiot that ends up failing at everything. There is a fine line between ambitious and plain naivety and be careful to always stay on the correct side of it\n4. MEDITATION\nMeditating has some serious life benefits. It’s not easy emptying your mind and concentrating on one thing and anyone who practices meditation for 20 minutes and says they achieve complete calm the whole time is a liar. The point is to recognise that you’ve gone off the rails and bring yourself back to the start. \nThe more you practice the better you get and you can focus on your work or task at hand with much less procrastination so that you can then quickly get onto the other things you enjoy. \nI have a slightly overly active mind and this has helped me certainly in working. but only last week for the first time did this help with sleep. I generally get some idiot idea in my brain or something from the day that pisses me off and I have these stupid conversation replay in my mind of what I’m going to do and it all goes nowhere. for the first time was I really able to step out of my own head. Tell myself I’m wasting my time and quiet the inner monkey. and next thing I was asleep. This might not sound like much to you but for me this was incredible. \nWhatever personal vices you have whether it’s being more grateful for the stuff around you. Being less stressed out or being more focused at work. \nMeditating on these subjects can bring real benefits and success in defining how you want to be as a person.\n5. BITCOIN\nIt would be a bit wrong to finish the year without talking about bitcoin. I’ve personally invested a fair amount of money in it and made some incredible gains over the year. I did a lot of research on the topic, listening and reading to everything I could. As a scientist I feely very safe in concluding that no one really knows what’s going on. It final hit virility and mainstream and no one really predicted exactly how that could play out. from one week to another the cryptocurrency of favour makes no real logical sense and you can’t predict it.\nMy personal recommendation if you are wanting to invest is to spread your money over quite a few currencies and don’t hedge your bets on just a few. Spending time trying to trade them is a huge risk where you will likely lose yourself money and a lot of time and gain a whole load of stress. It’s taking over the lives of so many people right now who have a severe addiction I really would advise just buying and not looking for a year too much.\nRegret minimisation I think is essential to be mindful of when it comes to crypto. On how much to invest decide in long run with a potential of 1000% gain or 100% loss what would you regret the least in ten years time and invest something you’re comfortable with. \nWhen taking money out or moving it remember it can shoot up again tomorrow or crash basically on a 50:50 basis. so if either of those events will fill you with regret don’t let captain hindsight beat you up later or panic when your holdings go down and sell everything.\nRemember to keep a more bird’s eye view of your investments rather than being caught up in each little one emotionally.\nSay you own 100 grand and you decide to put 5% into bitcoin. hypothetically that money grows to be 105 grand so you now are worth 200 grand.\nSo over 50% of your entire world money is in bitcoin. a highly volatile and risky place for it to be.\nSo let’s say you had no money in bitcoin but now own 200 grand, would you invest over 50% of all your money into Bitcoin? If not then you should take some out! Otherwise, why didn’t you put 50% into bitcoin in the first place?\nThis is a key lesson to keep you sane and more likely to sell high and buy low rather than the other way round which is a classic trap people fall into when a market feels like it’s sliding or going up and you end up buying at the peak form FOMO or selling in the dip from panic.\nCONTACT\nYou can email theo - theohricketts at gmail.com\nor check out his latest biz www.postary.com (https://www.postary.com/)\nSam:\nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/samjamsnaps/)\nQuora (https://www.quora.com/profile/Sam-Harris-58)\nTwitter (https://twitter.com/samharristweets)\nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharris48/)\nSubscribe!\nIf you enjoyed the podcast please subscribe and rate it.

Be Sensible About Equity\nRaising a large amount of money always seems like a good idea but ask yourself if you really need it straight away or if you can do without and retain a bigger holding and thus more control of your company. VC’s are often put off by companies where the founders don’t have a controlling share in the company.\nEqually, don’t be greedy and try to retain too much of your business. Selling at an inflated valuation can be damaging and limit your ability to raise further finance. So be realistic about your value and give out shares accordingly.\n2. Enjoy your commute\nPlan your living and working situation in a way that you enjoy your commute. It is one of the single biggest contributors to well being and happiness much more than most material items. So before taking on that higher paying job, ask your self will the commute make me happy, rather than will the money.\n3. Interview Strategy\nAsk Oddball questions to gauge more personality. If you think the candidate is a fit are worthwhile to spend time in the interview to make sure they really understand your business. Ensure that they have everything they need to make the decision to work for you.\n4. Have clear distinctions of roles for founders.\nCEO — to raise money and drive the vision\nCOO — to run the business and keep things together\nCTO — to build the tech\nEach person should have ownership of their area and be trusted by the others that they will deliver. Of course, you need to meet regularly to be sure your all working towards the same goal. But each in their different area and then stop getting in each other’s way.\n5. Plan realistically — Don’t take on too much\nExpect all of your plans to take twice as long and ensure to take on a minimal amount of stuff at any point in time so that you do it properly. And then you don’t get stressed out and deliver what you say will the way you want to!\nGive yourself time to focus on being awesome at minimal stuff instead of being poor at everything.\nBOOKS:\nQuiet Leadership: Winning Hearts, Minds and Matches  (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Quiet-Leadership-Winning-Hearts-Matches/dp/0241244943/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1A1R99SRGAT7Q&keywords=quiet+leadership&qid=1580046475&s=books&sprefix=quie%2Cstripbooks%2C486&sr=1-1)— Carlo Ancelotti\nA thoughtful insight into managing people and getting buy-in from others, it sounds like a great read and happy to add to my ever-growing list.

A leading technology company making mind-blowing technology that lets users feel the sensation of touch in mid-air. The future is coming and they are at the pinnacle of it.\nTom invented the technology behind Ultrahaptics alongside his professor in a research lab at the University of Bristol.  They have since grown the idea into one of the UK's most innovative businesses raising multiple rounds of funding with a rapidly growing team. You don’t go through events like this without learning a lot of lessons. \n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/3R14UFw\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3R14UFw.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\nOn the podcast, he shares some amazing insights into what he has learned along the way. It's an incredible story direct from the front line and I’m sure something all listeners will want to follow updates as their tech gets into the hands of consumers over the coming years.\nTOM’S TOP TIPS:\n1. Culture:\nI love the way he thinks about making a nice culture without trying to take over people’s lives to try and squeeze more work out of them. Just getting more hours out of people doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get more work\nAllow people more freedom from work, so work 9–5 and they can go home. They can enjoy the money they earn and live their own social lives.\nMake sure that meal times are utilised as a good way for the team to bond and get some down time, consider this in the layout of your office\n2. Focus on your strengths:\nI’ve got a lot of respect for the way he freely accepted taking on an incoming CEO so early on in the business, giving the company the management experience it needed to scale rapidly and allowing Tom to focus on driving innovation .\nKnow your own strengths and limitations and just step back\nBe willing to get better people to do things you can’t do as well, this can help you achieve far more in the long run and you might learn a thing or two from them in the process.\n3. Hiring\nHe has a lot of insight from so conducting so many interview conversations in a rapidly scaling company that has experienced barely any turn over of staff.\nApproach interviews as more open conversations with people rather than a structured process. Aim to just get a good feel for what they would be like and what they could be doing for you. They might even have a role in your company that you weren’t specifically interviewing for. Make a point to ask questions like:\nWhat are they proud of doing?\nWhat do they enjoy doing?\nWhat are they best at doing?\nWhen hiring for a top position, screen candidates until you get four people that can do the job and get them all in on the same day. Afterwards, If you can all agree that one can do the definitely do the job don’t waste time overthinking it and just hire them.\nBonus — Just do it\nKeep trying. success isn’t easy but if you have faith in the end goal even if it is a long way off it is worth the effort.\nGet out and try stuff whilst you’re still young! Don’t wait for life to happen to you because it comes around fast.\nTOM’S FAVOURITE BOOKS\nTHE HARD THING ABOUT HARD THINGS — BEN HOROWITZ\nthe tale of starting and growing a business to a billion dollars and losing it all and getting back and then nearly losing it and then starting another billion dollar business. Basically, there is no recipe for success and it is defined by what you do when things are going wrong.

Find top tips on maximising your time to achieve your goals that you can start implementing from day 1.

I listened on audible and literally read the whole thing in 2.5 days whilst travelling in Kazakhstan. I couldn’t stop listening. Such an engaging read.

A leading technology company making mind-blowing technology that lets users feel the sensation of touch in mid-air. The future is coming and they are at the pinnacle of it.</p>\n\n<p>Tom invented the technology behind Ultrahaptics alongside his professor in a research lab at the University of Bristol.  They have since grown the idea into one of the UK&#39;s most innovative businesses raising multiple rounds of funding with a rapidly growing team. You don’t go through events like this without learning a lot of lessons. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/3R14UFw\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/3R14UFw.jpg\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>On the podcast, he shares some amazing insights into what he has learned along the way. It&#39;s an incredible story direct from the front line and I’m sure something all listeners will want to follow updates as their tech gets into the hands of consumers over the coming years.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h5>TOM’S TOP TIPS:</h5>\n\n<h4>1. Culture:</h4>\n\n<p>I love the way he thinks about making a nice culture without trying to take over people’s lives to try and squeeze more work out of them. Just getting more hours out of people doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get more work</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Allow people more freedom from work, so work 9–5 and they can go home. They can enjoy the money they earn and live their own social lives.</p></li>\n<li><p>Make sure that meal times are utilised as a good way for the team to bond and get some down time, consider this in the layout of your office</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>2. Focus on your strengths:</h4>\n\n<p>I’ve got a lot of respect for the way he freely accepted taking on an incoming CEO so early on in the business, giving the company the management experience it needed to scale rapidly and allowing Tom to focus on driving innovation .</p>\n\n<p>Know your own strengths and limitations and just step back</p>\n\n<p>Be willing to get better people to do things you can’t do as well, this can help you achieve far more in the long run and you might learn a thing or two from them in the process.</p>\n\n<h4>3. Hiring</h4>\n\n<p>He has a lot of insight from so conducting so many interview conversations in a rapidly scaling company that has experienced barely any turn over of staff.</p>\n\n<p>Approach interviews as more open conversations with people rather than a structured process. Aim to just get a good feel for what they would be like and what they could be doing for you. They might even have a role in your company that you weren’t specifically interviewing for. Make a point to ask questions like:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>What are they proud of doing?</p></li>\n<li><p>What do they enjoy doing?</p></li>\n<li><p>What are they best at doing?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When hiring for a top position, screen candidates until you get four people that can do the job and get them all in on the same day. Afterwards, If you can all agree that one can do the definitely do the job don’t waste time overthinking it and just hire them.</p>\n\n<h4>Bonus — Just do it</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Keep trying. success isn’t easy but if you have faith in the end goal even if it is a long way off it is worth the effort.</p></li>\n<li><p>Get out and try stuff whilst you’re still young! Don’t wait for life to happen to you because it comes around fast.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h5>TOM’S FAVOURITE BOOKS</h5>\n\n<h4>THE HARD THING ABOUT HARD THINGS — BEN HOROWITZ</h4>\n\n<p>the tale of starting and growing a business to a billion dollars and losing it all and getting back and then nearly losing it and then starting another billion dollar business.

She actually got this from my nan who was a crazy awesome lady and used to send her kids to the neighbours randomly just so they would be okay if for some reason the parents died which I guess is the ultimate resilience for any child. Which is a practice I haven’t really heard of this day and age.\nMeditation and focus\nThis was a really big one for her. The practice of calming your mind and helping to find focus and peace. and from that Try not to do so many things at once so you can apply more focus to the things that are your priorities and ultimately be more successful as a whole. Remember that often less is more.\nTest your ideas, the earlier the better\nDon’t be afraid to start a business at uni if things go tits up your back at home with your parents . and it’s okay to play it safe and try less risky business models that aren’t going to change the world straight away but will help teach you the essentials of launching a business, you can then scale up when you have more time.\nBasically, think sensibly about what fits your situation the best and then try things that fit the potential market.
