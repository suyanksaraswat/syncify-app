Politics like this comes in three lanes; the safe lane, the radical lane, and the outsider lane. The problem is that too many politicians weave in and out of these lanes and come across as inauthentic. Then, Bernie Sanders is a real deal socialist. Sanders will bankrupt America in order to take over the lives of Americans. Later, Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn is a patriot that became a problem for the Obama Administration because he was open and honest that there was a growing problem within the intelligence community where intelligence officers and leaders were using the country's spying abilities to advance political influence as opposed to national security.

The Quincy Institute supports open borders the Iran deal and Koch has indicated that he may not support Trump in 2020. Afterword, Senator Warren makes another call to destroy the electoral college, which is typical of the left to destroy that with which they don't agree."},{"title":"Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 11/29/19","description":"On Friday's Mark Levin Show, we bring you the best of Mark Levin!

Who would Ukraine prefer, Obama or Trump? Moreover, we witnessed a disgusting abuse of power by Rep. Adam Schiff reading selected portions of a tweet from Trump and labeling it 'witness intimidation.' Schiff omitted portions of the tweet to misrepresent what the President was saying and it was in effect impossible to intimidate her, since ex Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch didn't know the President was even tweeting because she was in fact there testifying (precisely what Schiff said Trump was intimidating from her doing).

They need to stand up and use the truth that the Democrats also sent a letter signed by three Senators requesting the support of Ukraine in a DOJ investigation.  Then, Hillary Clinton who was involved in both Russian collusion and Ukranian collusion is now claiming that one of the Presidential Democratic candidates running is a Russian asset. If Tulsi Gabbard is an asset of the Russians and if she is enamored with Bashar al Asad then so is Speaker Nancy Pelosi!

Mulvaney's \"admission\" that the United States requested the cooperation of other nations to root-out corruption was perfectly legal. There was no demand for an investigation because there was already an ongoing public investigation about the 2016 server and other foreign governments that assisted the Democrats and Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. However, Jon Karl from ABC News describes this as a quid pro quo despite the lack of a \"this for that\" exchange.  There was no digging up of \"dirt\" it was a request to find out what happened. The Democrats will stop at nothing to drive their own narrative to protect Biden and smear Trump as a villain.  The reality is that there is no need to run for the hills, face the bullies because Trump and Mulvaney have done nothing wrong.  Getting to the bottom of the 2016 election is important because corrupt Ukrainians tried to help to elect Hillary Clinton by making false claims about Trump's fitness in 2016 and maligning his advisors, according to Politico's report on January 11th of 2017.

The American people deserve to have their president face his accuser if they're legitimately planning impeachment.  So far, they are absconding his identity to protect him from scrutiny so they can bamboozle as many citizens as they can get away with.  Afterward, from a legal perspective, this case would never stand up in court.  This whole thing is a phony cover-up being accepted, on its face, without scrutiny from the media.

The \"whistleblower\" pseudo-event is just hearsay.

Following Biden's on-camera threats of firing the Ukrainian prosecutor, Hunter Biden was named to the board of Barisma, a Ukrainian energy company.  Yet, there isn't a single Democrat willing to investigate this, or Hunter Biden's similar involvement with a Chinese company. Just like Hillary Clinton should have been indicted, Joe Biden needs to be held to account for what he did on behalf of his son which includes obstructing justice in and blackmail.  The media and the Senate should be asking scores of questions of Biden, instead of asking for the transcript of a private conversation between two presidents.

China has long been a threat over the past two decades and more recently China went on unchecked during the previous Administration. Trump is now using a tactic that President Reagan used with the Soviet Union, to soften china with diplomacy and pressure them to change their ways and potentially their leadership. Then, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates once during the entire Obama Administration, yet they have raised interest rates under Trump's presidency nearly half-a-dozen times!

They have been aggressive in taking over as many global ports as they can to control the flow of commerce. China has long been a threat over the past two decades and more recently China went on unchecked during the previous Administration. Trump is now using a tactic that President Reagan used with the Soviet Union, to soften china with diplomacy and pressure them to change their ways and potentially their leadership. Then, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates once during the entire Obama Administration, yet they have raised interest rates under Trump's presidency nearly half-a-dozen times! Later, Bernie Sanders has come out of his communist closet and admitted he wants to end American energy independence by nationalizing our oil companies. For the first time in U.S history America has become energy independent without a need to rely on foreign fossil fuels.

Nadler would have been a great commissar or apparatchik in the Soviet Union! According to Raoul Berger, the founders did not want the President reporting to Congress. Indeed, it was George Mason that suggested the wording of maladministration, which was challenged by James Madison and the phrase \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" was used in its place, so as to limit the power of removal of the president (not broad as Nadler suggests).

Then, Omar claims to love America more than naturalized citizens and says she's embarrassed and ashamed to live in this hypocrisy. Her lack of gratitude and appreciation for America is repulsive. It’s no wonder why the media, such as the NY Times, love these provocative Congresswomen and it stems from their abysmal failure to the American people on their coverage of the Holocaust.

Then, Clinton hitman and pseudo-journalist George Stephanopoulos tries to set-up President Trump with a gotcha question in a recent interview. Trump pushes back saying he'd have to check out the hypothetical information Stephanopoulos mentioned before calling the FBI for simply receiving opposition research. Stephanopoulos never asked Hillary Clinton if he thought it was wrong for Hillary’s campaign to hire a law firm, that hired a consulting firm, that hired an ex-British spy to provide opposition research obtained from Russian's — which actually did happen! Later, former Vice President Joe Biden's son continues to face criticism over dubious dealings with China and Ukraine.

Simply put, Robert Mueller had no basis for an indictment and that's why he didn't pursue any criminal charges; it's pretty open and shut. President Trump did not assert executive privilege and waived his attorney-client privilege by allowing White Counsel Don McGahn to speak with Mueller. Barr didn't have to release any of the report, but he chose to for the sake of transparency. While this is untrue it is likely because Mueller was upset about how the media has been portraying his report. Mueller's team of leakers are now reaping what they've sewn. Today they were called to the carpet for their leaking and Barr went on the record saying that there is an active investigation into criminal leaking.

President Trump did not assert executive privilege and waived his attorney-client privilege by allowing White Counsel Don McGahn to speak with Mueller. Barr didn't have to release any of the report, but he chose to for the sake of transparency. While this is untrue it is likely because Mueller was upset about how the media has been portraying his report. Mueller's team of leakers are now reaping what they've sewn.

Speaker Pelosi was weak in defending the anti-Semitism displayed by Rep Ilhan Omar and allows bigotry to continue to take root in the Democrat Party. The Democrat Party and the media allow hate speech with no condemnation and defend fundamentalist front groups like the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR). Rep. Steve King was excoriated for his comments and removed from committee assignments in Congress, yet Omar remains on the Foreign Relations Committee and goes unnamed in resolutions condemning her anti-Semitic rhetoric. The media is focused on destroying Fox News for their dissenting reports because they don’t go along with commentators that support the president, while they spend all their time trying to take President Trump down. Then, the Republicans need to step up; Sen. Mitch McConnell needs to whip the votes and support the president on the National Emergencies Act instead of adding to the problem like Sen. Rand Paul.

Printers were suppressed by the colonial governments through restrictive regulation on critical speech and matters of religion. As James Madison contemplated the revolution and America's founding and came up with 12 Amendments to the new Constitution, of which 10 were ratified—becoming the Bill of Rights. These amendments only applied to the new centralized federal government, not the states. Jefferson disagreed with how libel laws would be upheld and prosecuted at the state level. The Supreme Court eventually ruled on this creating a test for libel laws that opened Pandora’s box.

Despite all of Robert Mueller’s interviews and arrests, for unrelated process crimes, he still has no proof of collusion or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.  The goal of Trump's opposition has always been to destroy him, his policies, and his presidency.  Also, CNN's \"nose for news\" smells more like a leak than muckraking. The DOJ needs to initiate a leak investigation into why CNN was at Stone's house before the FBI even arrived because their explanation is weak and nonsensical. Then, Fox News Chief Intelligence Correspondent Catherine Herridge  calls in to discuss how the Stone arrest was handled and how rarely congressional testimony has been used as the basis for a grand jury indictment and other irregularities. Later, President Trump's problem with the border wall is that Republicans in the Senate are falling off the Trump Train. If his own team won’t stand with him in this fight it’s going to be tough. We need to stand with the President and give him three more weeks and see what they come up with - we’re not done yet.

In fact, any such action would pale in comparison to President Trump's predecessors' usage of the same Act. Many of these so-called \"conservative\" commentators are \"never-Trumpers\" that are doing America a disservice by omitting history and context from their analysis. Then, the New York Times spent the weekend joining the demagoguery and Russian propaganda theorizing on whether President Trump was a Russian spy, knowingly or unknowingly. Yet the only evidence that we've seen shows that the Obama Administration, DOJ, FBI abused the FISA Court to spy on Trump. They tried to go after Trump's team using the Logan Act as a pretext to start a criminal operation. They used political opposition research for these misdeeds, and they're still not done. The Democrats and the media have been in bed together in this unrelenting attack to reverse the outcome of the 2016 election by advancing their narrative of Trump-Russian collusion. Later, Sen. Diane Feinstein should be investigated for \"political espionage\" per a Federalist article in August of 2018."},{"title":"Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 1/11/19","description":"On Friday's Mark Levin Show, first, the partial government shutdown has actually only been going on for 13 days not 21; most government agencies are closed on weekends, Christmas and New Years Day.

This leaves our Kurdish and Israeli allies exposed and alone to fend for themselves. If we can't be bothered by what happens outside of America then why do we have bases abroad, why do we have aircraft carriers in international seas?

Sullivan accused a 3-star General, a hero, of treason. Retired Lt General Michael Flynn has a legal gun to his head and hasn't done anything that Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder and James Comey haven't done. His conversation with Ambassador Kislyak, and the substance of his conversation were not illegal. Yet the FBI interviewed him twice and advised him to waive his right to counsel, even though the protocol calls for it. Yet this Judge has the gall to call this General treasonous because he knows that he can say whatever he wants because of his black robe and lifetime appointment. This might be a shocker, but the vast majority of unregistered foreign agents lobbying abroad have not been prosecuted. Later, the increasing federal deficit is robbing our children and grandchildren - how dare they allow this to happen? When will the Republicans and White House start fighting back?

The US Dept. of Justice Memorandum clearly states that the Special Counsel must comply with DOJ regulations and cannot be indicted by Mueller and is not in legal jeopardy. Yet all the fools in the media can't seem to connect these dots. Mueller can still write a report filled with attacks but it seems that he ought to be speaking in the courtroom or not at all. It is not the role of the special counsel or the DOJ (executive branch) to lead a political process like impeachment. Simply put, the president of the United States cannot be indicted and will not be indicted. Moreover, Trump has not obstructed justice. The same people that want to destroy our border, embrace socialism in our country, and the same people that are trying to undo the results of the 2016 election are the same people trying to sabotage the presidency of Trump. The media is a function of what is best for the citizenry not what's best for their ideology. Also, Sen. Bob Dole gave a final salute to President George H.W. Bush as he lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda. He stood and saluted with the help of an aide to pay his respects.

The US Dept. of Justice Memorandum clearly states that the Special Counsel must comply with DOJ regulations and cannot be indicted by Mueller and is not in legal jeopardy. Yet all the fools in the media can't seem to connect these dots. Mueller can still write a report filled with attacks but it seems that he ought to be speaking in the courtroom or not at all. It is not the role of the special counsel or the DOJ (executive branch) to lead a political process like impeachment. Simply put, the president of the United States cannot be indicted and will not be indicted. Moreover, Trump has not obstructed justice. The same people that want to destroy our border, embrace socialism in our country, and the same people that are trying to undo the results of the 2016 election are the same people trying to sabotage the presidency of Trump. The media is a function of what is best for the citizenry not what's best for their ideology. Also, Sen. Bob Dole gave a final salute to President George H.W. Bush as he lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda. He stood and saluted with the help of an aide to pay his respects.

Afterwards, NBC's Andrea Mitchell calls Devin Nunes a clown on television, clearly departing with objectivity when making that judgment. The hard news people on TV should just tell the truth and call themselves liberal commentators and stop pretending to be objective journalists.

This is perfectly legitimate, there’s nothing wrong whatsoever. Now they've trained their sights on the new Acting Attorney General, Matthew Whitaker already smearing him. Then, last night's election was no blue wave, it was a blue tinkle. They just won a 12-seat plurality above the Republicans in the House and they lost seats in the Senate. Plus, CNN's Jim Acosta disguises his allegations against the president at today's press conference, then nearly assaults a female staffer when refusing to release the White House press microphone and was subsequently banned from the White House. Afterwards, NBC's Andrea Mitchell calls Devin Nunes a clown on television, clearly departing with objectivity when making that judgment. The hard news people on TV should just tell the truth and call themselves liberal commentators and stop pretending to be objective journalists. The way the media speaks to our President is not acceptable in any professional environment. Speaking over others, interrupting others and their snide and cynical attacks disguised as questions would never fly in the workplace, yet they continue to treat the president this way. Finally, Rep. Jerrold Nadler slipped and revealed plans to impeach Trump and Brett Kavanaugh in a conversation heard on a Washington DC train."},{"title":"Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 11/6/18","description":"On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, it’s midterm election Day and we're monitoring all of the races live as the polls begin to close.

Obama was very angry that Trump has reversed about 75 percent of the eight years of his presidency. Obama's anti-semitic policies have been reversed by Trump. Obama was weak on ISIS, China, and the border yet Trump has been strong on these issues. Obama is probably jealous that Putin is getting all the credit for interfering in the 2016 election that Obama was responsible for. Also, Obama says that “we went from great progressive change to periods of retrenchment\" suggesting that the target of progressivism is the US Constitution and our individual liberties.

Obama was very angry that Trump has reversed about 75 percent of the eight years of his presidency. Obama's anti-semitic policies have been reversed by Trump. Obama was weak on ISIS, China, and the border yet Trump has been strong on these issues. Obama is probably jealous that Putin is getting all the credit for interfering in the 2016 election that Obama was responsible for. Also, Obama says that “we went from great progressive change to periods of retrenchment\" suggesting that the target of progressivism is the US Constitution and our individual liberties.

Because Trump cannot be indicted, he will not have a chance to defend himself in a court of law. Trump will be tried in the media instead, and the Democrats will use special counsel Robert Mueller’s report to make the case for impeachment. What’s happened here is diabolical and evil. Also, the government must prove that the Trump campaign violations are in fact illegal, but they can't. Cohen took the plea deal; to protect his wife that was rumored to be implicated in his case. So now their game is guilt by association, if Cohen pled guilty, therefore Trump must be guilty, but this isn't so. Finally, Salena Zito calls in to discuss facebook’s censorship of her NY Post story on Cohen and Paul Manafort for not meeting community standards."},{"title":"Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 8/23/18","description":"On Thursday’s Mark Levin show, Longtime owner of the National Enquirer, David Pecker, was granted federal immunity to divulge details about affairs alleged by women with then-candidate Trump.

China wants Apple's technology and products and Apple is stuck because they sold out. China is our enemy and are trying to become the world’s #1 superpower and they steal our technology to do so. Also, you have to wonder with all that President Trump has to worry about when dealing with Iran, North Korea, China, Russia and Turkey – does the media and Democrats really care about this country with their outrageous attacks on him? Trump has been stronger on national security than any President since Ronald Reagan and he trying to keep us safe even with the attacks on him. Later, Senator Dianne Feinstein and her husband continue to deny any conflicts of interest with China despite mounting scrutiny over her husband’s investments for more than 20 years. Has Feinstein ever recused herself from any issues related to China like Jeff Sessions had to recuse himself from Russia? She should be banned from any committee she sits on – she’s a danger.

For decades Presidents on both sides of the aisle have kissed up to foreign leaders and nothing ever really changed. But today President Trump sat at the table and called out our NATO allies for supporting Russian aggression. Trump definitely plays by his own rules. He cares about results, not the structured rules of diplomacy and the media can’t accept this. He’s always under attack because of his Queens, NY bravado. New Yorkers from Queens don’t get the same respect as kids from Brooklyn and the Bronx, so you have to puff your chest a bit and prove that you're tough to earn respect. This is why his personality is always focused on the superlative tense. Then, liberalism sucks for liberals too. There is no popular mandate for liberal idiocy and their ignorance is what allows liberal ideology to thrive. There is no public mandate for liberalism so all they need to do is convince one judge, or politician in a black robe, and they get their legislation from the court. If Dems believed that Roe v.

For decades Presidents on both sides of the aisle have kissed up to foreign leaders and nothing ever really changed. But today President Trump sat at the table and called out our NATO allies for supporting Russian aggression. Trump definitely plays by his own rules. He cares about results, not the structured rules of diplomacy and the media can’t accept this. He’s always under attack because of his Queens, NY bravado. New Yorkers from Queens don’t get the same respect as kids from Brooklyn and the Bronx, so you have to puff your chest a bit and prove that you're tough to earn respect. This is why his personality is always focused on the superlative tense. Then, liberalism sucks for liberals too. There is no popular mandate for liberal idiocy and their ignorance is what allows liberal ideology to thrive. There is no public mandate for liberalism so all they need to do is convince one judge, or politician in a black robe, and they get their legislation from the court. If Dems believed that Roe v. Wade was actually settled law they wouldn't be scared. If there was a popular mandate for any of their ideas they wouldn't use fear tactics.

The Inspector General report exposed media outlets giving gifts to FBI agents in exchange for leaks, proving they are corrupt and do nothing to defend the freedom of the press. Meanwhile, James Comey was justifyably fired for his insubordinate, corrupt behavior, and should have been fired before Trump was elected. Also, there’s no discussion on TV that places the responsibility on the illegal alien parents, who are separated from their children while they are processed and detained. If they weren’t separated, the children would be detained in an adult facility with their parents. Illegal alien children aren’t put in dog cages; they’re housed, fed, and clothed on the taxpayer’s dime. This policy is suddenly inhumane despite existing for decades, including under the Obama administration. Later, President Trump ordered tariffs on $50 billion of particular Chinese imports because they’ve been stealing our technology and devaluing their currency.

Meanwhile, James Comey was justifyably fired for his insubordinate, corrupt behavior, and should have been fired before Trump was elected. Also, there’s no discussion on TV that places the responsibility on the illegal alien parents, who are separated from their children while they are processed and detained. If they weren’t separated, the children would be detained in an adult facility with their parents. Illegal alien children aren’t put in dog cages; they’re housed, fed, and clothed on the taxpayer’s dime. This policy is suddenly inhumane despite existing for decades, including under the Obama administration.

Now there’s finally a judge who gets it in this case and suggested that Mueller lied about the scope of his investigation and that Mueller just wants to get President Trump.

If a president can’t be indicted, what’s the purpose of Mueller’s investigation? To get to the bottom of what happened in election? No, not according to Mueller’s questions to Trump. Mueller’s appointment was illegitimate because there is no crime for him to investigate. Trump needs to use his constitutional powers and fight back against Mueller’s probe.

When the conservative media was backing away from Manafort, Mark explained his admiration for him not buckling. It wasn’t about him being guilty or not, it was about what our government is turning into. Now there’s finally a judge who gets it in this case and suggested that Mueller lied about the scope of his investigation and that Mueller just wants to get President Trump. Also, almost a year ago Mark laid out the case that, according to Department of Justice policy, you can’t indict a sitting President. If a president can’t be indicted, what’s the purpose of Mueller’s investigation? To get to the bottom of what happened in election? No, not according to Mueller’s questions to Trump. Mueller’s appointment was illegitimate because there is no crime for him to investigate. Trump needs to use his constitutional powers and fight back against Mueller’s probe.

They are stealing our technology and military designs and it’s not to help their people but to build up their military. The issue with China is being discussed in the context of trade but that’s not right. This isn’t about a trade war, it’s about our national security and defending trade and commerce. Also, the United States has issued more sanctions today on Russian oligarchs, proving once again that Trump is harder on Vladimir Putin and Russia more so than Barack Obama ever was. Later, Robert Mueller is a rogue prosecutor who is investigating nothing. There is no underlying crime. The official position of the Department of Justice is that a president cannot be indicted while he is in office.

Now, the Israeli media is launching a pre-emptive attack on Netanyahu before his interview with Mark which airs on Sunday on Fox News. The media in Israel is full of leftist, pro-socialist appeasers. Also, we now know that the Obama administration affirmatively refused to stop the Russian cyberattacks during the 2016 election. Susan Rice told Michael Daniel, White House director of cybersecurity, to cease and desist efforts to fight back on Russian hacking. Rice told Daniel and his team to stand down so they didn’t box in Obama; if they gave him options he’d have to act. Obama didn’t want to do anything to stop the Russians because he was sure Hillary Clinton would be elected and didn’t want anyone to say the election was fraudulent. Obama let Russian cyberattacks slide because in the end he was all about power, not integrity, and is now at the center of this monumental scandal. Later, Trump deserves great credit for how he’s handled North Korea, not the vicious attacks he’s getting from the media.

The story is that Prince, an American citizen, was spied on by the Obama administration 9 days before Trump’s inaugration for no reason and then leaked his name to the media. There is no justification for spying on people realted to Trump’s campaign and it’s a disgrace that the media is protecting Obama’s spying. Do you realize how remarkable it is that Trump is President? FBI resources, the Obama White House, the Hillary Clinton campaign and the DNC all conspired to destroy Trump and the people around him. This is why there needs to be another special council appointed. Later, people who previously were proud capitalists have decided that Bernie Sanders and Herbert Hoover were right on tariffs. How can they embrace tariffs under Trump but rejected it under Obama? These Republicans supporting this are not standing for the little guy anymore because these are taxes on us. Finally, South Korea had a major announcement that Kim Jong Un wants to meet with Trump and prepare to denuclearize. North Korea has spent decades perfecting their ICBM’s and nuclear warheads.

Their position today is to believe in the 10th Amendment and that states can decide their own immigration policy. However, the left and President Obama attacked Arizona for claiming the same thing a few years ago, taking Arizona to the Supreme Court to determine that the Federal government controls immigration. Everyone on the left attacked Arizona for defying Obama and enforcing federal law, but today they want California to create their own immigration policy and defy federal law. Their immigration policies aren’t intended to help the country; they’re intended to help the Democrat party and the progressive ideology. Also, prior Federal governments would punish states by cutting off funding to states that didn’t comply. Now the very people who did that in the past object to it being done today. This is why you can’t take a progressive’s argument seriously, but need to take what they’re doing very seriously. Later, justifying a tariff on steel because China is dumping steel is the biggest lie in modern times. Chinese steel makes up 2% of steel imports, while 70% of domestic production is done by domestic companies. No car manufacturer, dishwasher, or HVAC producer controls 70% of their market, yet a handful of American steel companies control 70% of the steel market; any industry controlling 70% should be considered a monopoly.
