It’s humid and soggy, filled with thorns and thickets, teeming with all sorts of dangerous and unpleasant wildlife. The panthers that used to live there are now gone, but even today there are black bears, poisonous snakes, and swarms of yellow flies and mosquitoes.<br><br>\nHundreds of years ago, before the Civil War, the dangers of the swamp and its seeming impenetrability actually attracted people to it. The land was so untamed that horses and boats couldn’t enter, and the colonists who were filing into the region detested it. William Byrd II, a Virginia planter, called it “a miserable morass where nothing can inhabit.” But people did inhabit the swamp, including thousands of enslaved Africans and African Americans who escaped their captors and formed communities in the swamp. This “dismal” landscape was the site of one of the most remarkable and least told stories of resistance to slavery in American history.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://99percentinvisible.org/?p=20948&amp;post_type=episode\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">The Great Dismal Swamp</a></p>\n      ","subtitle":"On the border of Virginia and North Carolina stretches a great, dismal swamp.
