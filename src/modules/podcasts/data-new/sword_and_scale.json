This week we are joined by Keelan Balderson from WideShut to cover a case that is hauntingly familiar, but occurring in modern-day Europe.\n\nWhen Ella Draper met marijuana-advocate Abraham Christie her life, and the lives of her two young children, spiraled out of control. According to Mrs Justice Pauffley, the presiding judge in the case, Christie was an abusive man who punished the children by hitting them with metal spoons and kicking them in the stomach. According to Pauffley's ruling, the couple brainwashed the two kids into making up an elaborate story about a satanic cult committing the ritualistic murder of children. Not surprisingly, at the head of the cult, was the children's father who was in the midst of a bitter custody dispute with Draper at the time.\n\nA bizarre cast of characters, including software engineer turned victim's advocate Sabine McNeill, refuses to believe the judges ruling and instead continue to argue that the whole thing is a grand conspiracy reaching the highest levels of government, despite the total lack of physical evidence in the case.

You have a one in a hundred chance of encountering one on any given day. Most are non-violent people struggling with what can sometimes be a debilitating disease, but every now and then the voices in their head can lead a handful of them down a path from which there is no return. For the rest of us, no knowing if the person next to you is capable of murdering and dismembering you at any given moment can be utterly terrifying.\n\nThis week we tell you the story of three people who were minding their own business, going about their day either taking a trip, going to work, or just relaxing at home after a long day. Each of these people have one thing in common: they all became victims unexpectedly to a case of the severe mental illness of another, as well as a flawed healthcare system that fails to treat and help these people.\n\nIn this episode we discuss the cases of Vince Weiguang Li, Alton Nolen and Derek Ward. All three of these men decapitated their victims, with a complete lack of empathy or mercy, while undergoing a severe psychotic episode. The brutality of their attacks are unimaginable and terrifying.
