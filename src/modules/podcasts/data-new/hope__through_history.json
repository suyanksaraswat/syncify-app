{"meta":{"title":"Hope, Through History","description":"Welcome to Hope, Through History, with Pulitzer Prize Winning and Best Selling Author and Historian, Jon Meacham and directed and produced by Cadence13, in partnership with HISTORY. HTH explores some of the most historic and trying times in American History, and how this nation dealt with these moments, the impact of these moments and how we came through these moments a unified nation. Season One takes a look at critical moments around the 1918 Flu Pandemic, the Great Depression, World War II, the polio epidemic and the Cuban Missile Crisis. These stories of crisis—the term originates in the writings of Hippocrates, as a moment in the course of a disease where a patient either lives or dies—are rich, and in our own 2020 hour of pandemic and slow-motion but indisputably real panic, there’s utility in re-engaging with the stories of how leaders and citizens have reacted amid tension and tumult. The vicissitudes of history always challenge us in new and often-confounding ways; that’s in the nature of things. Still, as Winston Churchill once remarked, “The future is unknowable, but the past should give us hope”—the hope that human ingenuity, reason, and character can combine to save us from the abyss and keep us on a path, in another phrase of Churchill’s, to broad, sun-lit uplands.","subtitle":"","imageURL":"https://images.megaphone.fm/_6HWRZtoqW2HCY_YslhE-eH4wE25Tl8FTW7OdnUn9rk/plain/s3://megaphone-prod/podcasts/d7209054-7a9e-11ea-8538-ab7bc78732e3/image/uploads_2F1587508000666-osgdxbsie7-db6d6ab7cf66714ceeefccc65678676e_2FHope_2C%2BThrough%2BHistory%2BFINAL%2BCOVER.jpg","link":"https://shows.cadence13.com/podcast/hope-through-history","language":"en","author":"Cadence13, Jon Meacham & HISTORY","summary":"Welcome to Hope, Through History, with Pulitzer Prize Winning and Best Selling Author and Historian, Jon Meacham and directed and produced by Cadence13, in partnership with HISTORY.
