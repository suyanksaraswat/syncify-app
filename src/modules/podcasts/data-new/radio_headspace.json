Very often, that can look like a very strict daily schedule, a list of books and movies to cross off your queue, or perhaps keeping the home very tidy. It’s good to have order, but being too strict with it means we feel like we’re falling apart when one thing is out of line.

If you’re with others, it’s tempting to look at taking time for yourself as selfish, but in solitude, we can find a way to reconnect with ourselves. And when we go back out into life we can be better for ourselves, and for the people around us. \n","subtitle":"Today is Monday, May 18, 2020","pubDate":"2020-05-18T07:05:00.000Z","enclosure":{"length":"0","type":"audio/mpeg","url":"https://traffic.megaphone.fm/CAD6233201480.mp3"},"duration":172,"summary":"Finding time for yourself may seem like an odd concept — especially if you’re quarantining alone — but it’s easy to get distracted, from being caught up in Zoom calls to binge-watching TV or constantly reading the news.
